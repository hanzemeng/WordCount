The Hunger Games


The Hunger Games 1by Suzanne Collins

PART I"THE TRIBUTES"

1.

When I wake up, the other side of the bed is cold. My fingers stretch out, seeking Prims warmth but finding only the rough canvas cover of the mattress. She must have had bad dreams and climbed in with our mother. Of course, she did. This is the day of the reaping. I prop myself up on one elbow. Theres enough light in the bedroom to see them. My little sister, Prim, curled up on her side, cocooned in my mothers body, their cheeks pressed together. In sleep, my mother looks younger, still worn but not so beaten-down. Prims face is as fresh as a raindrop, as lovely as the primrose for which she was named. My mother was very beautiful once, too. Or so

they tell me. Sitting at Prims knees, guarding her, is the worlds ugliest cat. Mashed-in nose, half of one ear missing, eyes the color of rotting squash. Prim named him Buttercup, insisting that his muddy yellow coat matched the bright flower. I he hates me. Or at least distrusts me. Even though it was years ago, I think he still remembers how I tried to drown him in a bucket when Prim brought him home. Scrawny kitten, belly swollen with worms, crawling with fleas. The last thing I needed was another mouth to feed. But Prim begged so hard, cried even, I had to let him stay. It turned out okay. My mother got rid of the vermin and hes a born mouser. Even catches the occasional rat. Sometimes, when I clean a kill, I feed Buttercup the entrails. He has stopped hissing at me. Entrails. No hissing. This is the closest we will ever come to love. I swing my legs off the bed and slide into my hunting boots. Supple leather that has molded to my feet. I pull on trousers, a shirt, tuck my long dark braid up into a cap, and grab my forage bag. On the table, under a wooden bowl to protect it from hungry rats and cats alike, sits a perfect little goat cheese wrapped in basil leaves. Prims gift to me on reaping day. I put the cheese carefully in my pocket as I slip outside. Our part of District 12, nicknamed the Seam, is usually crawling with coal miners heading out to the morning shift at this hour. Men and women with hunched shoulders, swollen knuckles, many who have long since stopped trying to scrub the coal dust out of their broken nails, the lines of their sunken faces. But today the black cinder streets are empty. Shutters on the squat gray houses are closed. The reaping isnt until two. May as well sleep in. If you can. Our house is almost at the edge of the Seam. I only have to pass a few gates to reach the scruffy field called the Meadow. Separating the Meadow from the woods, in fact enclosing all of District 12, is a high chain-link fence topped with barbed-wire loops. In theory, its supposed to be electrified twenty-four hours a day as a deterrent to the predators that live in the woods packs of wild dogs, lone cougars, bears that used to threaten our streets. But since were lucky to get two or three hours of electricity in the evenings, its

usually safe to touch. Even so, I always take a moment to listen carefully for the hum that means the fence is live. Right now, its silent as a stone. Concealed by a clump of bushes, I flatten out on my belly and slide under a two-foot stretch thats

been loose for years. There are several other weak spots in the fence, but this one is so close to home I almost always enter the woods here. As soon as Im in the trees, I retrieve a bow and sheath of arrows from a hollow log. Electrified or not, the fence has been successful at keeping the flesh-eaters out of District 12. Inside the woods they roam freely, and there are added concerns like venomous snakes, rabid animals, and no real paths to follow. But theres also food if you know how to find it. My father knew and he taught me some before he was blown to bits in a mine explosion. There was nothing even to bury. I was eleven then. Five years later, I still wake up screaming for him to run. Even though trespassing in the woods is illegal and poaching carries the severest of penalties, more people would risk it if they had weapons. But most are not bold enough to venture out with just a knife. My bow is a rarity, crafted by my father along with a few others that I keep well hidden in the woods, carefully wrapped in waterproof covers. My father could have made good money selling them, but if the officials found out he would have been publicly executed for inciting a rebellion. Most of the Peacekeepers turn a blind eye to the few of us who hunt because theyre as hungry for fresh meat as anybody is. In fact, theyre among our best customers. But the idea that someone might be arming the Seam would never have been allowed. In the fall, a few brave souls sneak into the woods to harvest apples. But always in sight of the Meadow. Always close enough to run back to the safety of District 12 if trouble arises. District Twelve. Where you can starve to death in safety, I mutter. Then I glance quickly over my shoulder. Even here, even in the middle of nowhere, you worry someone might overhear you. When I was younger, I scared my mother to death, the things I would blurt out about District 12, about the people who rule our country, Panem, from the far-off city called the Capitol. Eventually I understood this would only lead us to more trouble. So I learned to hold my tongue and to turn my features into an indifferent mask so that no one could ever read my thoughts. Do my work quietly in school. Make only polite small talk in the public market. Discuss little more than trades in the Hob, which is the black market where I make most of my money. Even at home, where I am less pleasant, I avoid discussing tricky topics. Like the reaping, or food shortages, or the Hunger Games. Prim might begin to repeat my words and then where would we be? In the woods waits the only person with whom I can be myself. Gale. I can feel the

muscles in my face relaxing, my pace quickening as I climb the hills to our place, a rock ledge

overlooking a valley. A thicket of berry bushes protects it from unwanted eyes. The sight of him waiting there brings on a smile. Gale says I never smile except in the woods. Hey, Catnip, says Gale. My real name is Katniss, but when I first told him, I had barely whispered it. So he thought Id said Catnip. Then when this crazy lynx started following me around the woods looking for handouts, it became his official nickname for me. I finally had to kill the lynx because he scared off game. I almost regretted it because he wasnt bad company. But I got a decent price for his pelt. Look what I shot, Gale holds up a loaf of bread with an arrow stuck in it, and I laugh. Its real bakery bread, not the flat, dense loaves we make from our grain rations. I take it in my hands, pull out the arrow, and hold the puncture in the crust to my nose, inhaling the fragrance that makes my mouth flood with saliva. Fine bread like this is for special occasions. Mm, still warm, I say. He must have been at the bakery at the crack of dawn to trade for it. What did it cost you? Just a squirrel. Think the old man was feeling sentimental this morning, says Gale. Even wished me luck. Well, we all feel a little closer today, dont we? I say, not even bothering to roll my eyes. Prim left us a cheese. I pull it out. His expression brightens at the treat. Thank you, Prim. Well have a real feast. Suddenly he falls into a Capitol accent as he mimics Effie Trinket, the maniacally upbeat woman who arrives once a year to read out the names at the leaping. I almost forgot! Happy Hunger Games! He plucks a few blackberries from the bushes around us. And may the odds He tosses a berry in a high arc toward me. I catch it in my mouth and break the delicate skin with my teeth. The sweet tartness explodes across my tongue. Be ever in your favor! I finish with equal verve. We have to joke about it because the alternative is to be scared out of your wits. Besides, the Capitol accent is so affected, almost anything sounds funny in it. I watch as Gale pulls out his knife and slices the bread. He could be my brother. Straight black hair, olive skin, we even have the same gray eyes. But were not related, at least not closely. Most of the families who work the mines resemble one another this way. Thats why my mother and Prim, with their light hair and blue eyes, always look out of place. They are. My mothers parents were part of the small merchant class that

caters to officials, Peacekeepers, and the occasional Seam customer. They ran an apothecary shop in the nicer part of District 12. Since almost no one can afford doctors, apothecaries are our healers. My father got to know my mother because on his hunts he would sometimes collect medicinal herbs and sell them to her shop to be brewed into remedies. She must have really loved him to leave her home for the Seam. I try to remember that when all I can see is the woman who sat by, blank and unreachable, while her children turned to skin and bones. I

try to forgive her for my fathers sake. But to be honest, Im not the forgiving type. Gale spreads the bread slices with the soft goat cheese, carefully placing a basil leaf on each while I strip the bushes of their berries. We settle back in a nook in the rocks. From this place, we are invisible but have a clear view of the valley, which is teeming with summer life, greens to gather, roots to dig, fish iridescent in the sunlight. The day is glorious, with a blue sky and soft breeze. The foods wonderful, with the cheese seeping into the warm bread and the berries bursting in our mouths. Everything would be perfect if this really was a holiday, if all the day off meant was roaming the mountains with Gale, hunting for tonights supper. But instead we have to be standing in the square at two oclock waiting for the names to be called out. We could do it, you know, Gale says quietly. What? I ask. Leave the district. Run off. Live in the woods. You and I, we could make it, says Gale. I dont know how to respond. The idea is so preposterous. If we didnt have so many kids, he adds quickly. Theyre not our kids, of course. But they might as well be. Gales two little brothers and a sister. Prim. And you may as well throw in our mothers, too, because how would they live without us? Who would fill those mouths that are always asking for more? With both of us hunting daily, there are still nights when game has to be swapped for lard or shoelaces or wool, still nights when we go to bed with our stomachs growling. I never want to have kids, I say. I might. If I didnt live here, says Gale. But you do, I say, irritated. Forget it, he snaps back. The conversation feels all wrong. Leave? How could I leave Prim, who is the only person in the world Im certain I love? And Gale is devoted to his family. We cant leave, so why bother talking about it? And even if we did . . . Even if we did . . . Where did this stuff about having kids come from? Theres never been anything romantic between Gale and me. When we met, I was a skinny

twelve-year-old, and although he was only two years older, he already looked like a man. It took a long time for us to even become friends, to stop haggling over every trade and begin helping each other out. Besides, if he wants kids, Gale wont have any trouble finding a wife. Hes good-looking, hes strong enough to handle the work in the mines, and he can hunt. You can tell by the way the girls whisper about him when he walks by in school that they want him. It makes me jealous but not for the reason people would think. Good hunting partners are hard to find. What do you want to do? I ask. We can hunt, fish, or gather. Lets fish at the lake. We can leave our poles and gather in the woods. Get something nice for tonight, he says. Tonight. After the reaping, everyone is supposed to celebrate. And a lot of people do, out of relief that their children have been spared for another year. But at least two families will pull their shutters, lock their doors,

and try to figure out how they will survive the painful weeks to come. We make out well. The predators ignore us on a day when easier, tastier prey abounds. By late morning, we have a dozen fish, a bag of greens and, best of all, a gallon of strawberries. I found the patch a few years ago, but Gale had the idea to string mesh nets around it to keep out the animals. On the way home, we swing by the Hob, the black market that operates in an abandoned warehouse that once held coal. When they came up with a more efficient system that transported the coal directly from the mines to the trains, the Hob gradually took over the space. Most businesses are closed by this time on reaping day, but the black markets still fairly busy. We easily trade six of the fish for good bread, the other two for salt. Greasy Sae, the bony old woman who sells bowls of hot soup from a large kettle, takes half the greens off our hands in exchange for a couple of chunks of paraffin. We might do a tad better elsewhere, but we make an effort to keep on good terms with Greasy Sae. Shes the only one who can consistently be counted on to buy wild dog. We dont hunt them on purpose, but if youre attacked and you take out a dog or two, well, meat is meat. Once its in the soup, Ill call it beef, Greasy Sae says with a wink. No one in the Seam would turn up their nose at a good leg of wild dog, but the Peacekeepers who come to the Hob can afford to be a little choosier. When we finish our business at the market, we go to the back door of the mayors house to sell half the strawberries, knowing he has

a particular fondness for them and can afford our price. The mayors daughter, Madge, opens the door. Shes in my year at school. Being the mayors daughter, youd expect her to be a snob, but shes all right. She just keeps to herself. Like me. Since neither of us really has a group of friends, we seem to end up together a lot at school. Eating lunch, sitting next to each other at assemblies, partnering for sports activities. We rarely talk, which suits us both just fine. Today her drab school outfit has been replaced by an expensive white dress, and her blonde hair is done up with a pink ribbon. Reaping clothes. Pretty dress, says Gale. Madge shoots him a look, trying to see if its a genuine compliment or if hes just being ironic. It is a pretty dress, but she would never be wearing it ordinarily. She presses her lips together and then smiles. Well, if I end up going to the Capitol, I want to look nice, dont I? Now its Gales turn to be confused. Does she mean it? Or is she messing with him? Im guessing the second. You wont be going to the Capitol, says Gale coolly. His eyes land on a small, circular pin that adorns her dress. Real gold. Beautifully crafted. It could keep a family in bread for months. What can you have? Five entries? I had six when I was just twelve years old. Thats not her fault, I say. No, its no ones fault. Just the way it is, says Gale. Madges face has become closed off.

She puts the money for the berries in my hand. Good luck, Katniss. You, too, I say, and the door closes. We walk toward the Seam in silence. I dont like that Gale took a dig at Madge, but hes right, of course. The reaping system is unfair, with the poor getting the worst of it. You become eligible for the reaping the day you turn twelve. That year, your name is entered once. At thirteen, twice. And so on and so on until you reach the age of eighteen, the final year of eligibility, when your name goes into the pool seven times. Thats true for every citizen in all twelve districts in the entire country of Panem. But heres the catch. Say you are poor and starving as we were. You can opt to add your name more times in exchange for tesserae. Each tessera is worth a meager years supply of grain and oil for one person. You may do this for each of your family members as well. So, at the age of twelve, I had my name entered four times. Once, because I had to, and three times for tesserae for grain and oil for myself, Prim, and my mother. In fact, every year I have needed to do this. And the entries are cumulative. So now, at the age of sixteen, my name will be in the

reaping twenty times. Gale, who is eighteen and has been either helping or single-handedly feeding a family of five for seven years, will have his name in forty-two times. You can see why someone like Madge, who has never been at risk of needing a tessera, can set him off. The chance of her name being drawn is very slim compared to those of us who live in the Seam. Not impossible, but slim. And even though the rules were set up by the Capitol, not the districts, certainly not Madges family, its hard not to resent those who dont have to sign up for tesserae. Gale knows his anger at Madge is misdirected. On other days, deep in the woods, Ive listened to him rant about how the tesserae are just another tool to cause misery in our district. A way to plant hatred between the starving workers of the Seam and those who can generally count on supper and thereby ensure we will never trust one another. Its to the Capitols advantage to have us divided among ourselves, he might say if there were no ears to hear but mine. If it wasnt reaping day. If a girl with a gold pin and no tesserae had not made what Im sure she thought was a harmless comment. As we walk, I glance over at Gales face, still smoldering underneath his stony expression. His rages seem pointless to me, although I never say so. Its not that I dont agree with him. I do. But what good is yelling about the Capitol in the middle of the woods? It doesnt change anything. It doesnt make things fair. It doesnt fill our stomachs. In fact, it scares off the nearby game. I let him yell though. Better he does it in the woods than in the district. Gale and I divide our spoils, leaving two fish, a couple of loaves of good bread, greens, a quart of strawberries, salt, paraffin, and a bit of money for each. See you in the square, I say. Wear something

pretty, he says flatly. At home, I find my mother and sister are ready to go. My mother wears a fine dress from her apothecary days. Prim is in my first reaping outfit, a skirt and ruffled blouse. Its a bit big on her, but my mother has made it stay with pins. Even so, shes having trouble keeping the blouse tucked in at the back. A tub of warm water waits for me. I scrub off the dirt and sweat from the woods and even wash my hair. To my surprise, my mother has laid out one of her own lovely dresses for me. A soft blue thing with matching shoes. Are you sure? I ask. Im trying to get past rejecting offers of help from her. For a while, I was so angry, I wouldnt allow her to do anything for me. And this is something special. Her clothes from her

past are very precious to her. Of course. Lets put your hair up, too, she says. I let her towel-dry it and braid it up on my head. I can hardly recognize myself in the cracked mirror that leans against the wall. You look beautiful, says Prim in a hushed voice. And nothing like myself, I say. I hug her, because I know these next few hours will be terrible for her. Her first reaping. Shes about as safe as you can get, since shes only entered once. I wouldnt let her take out any tesserae. But shes worried about me. That the unthinkable might happen. I protect Prim in every way I can, but Im powerless against the reaping. The anguish I always feel when shes in pain wells up in my chest and threatens to register on my (ace. I notice her blouse has pulled out of her skirt in the back again and force myself to stay calm. Tuck your tail in, little duck, I say, smoothing the blouse back in place. Prim giggles and gives me a small Quack. Quack yourself, I say with a light laugh. The kind only Prim can draw out of me. Come on, lets eat, I say and plant a quick kiss on the top of her head. The fish and greens are already cooking in a stew, but that will be for supper. We decide to save the strawberries and bakery bread for this evenings meal, to make it special we say. Instead we drink milk from Prims goat, Lady, and eat the rough bread made from the tessera grain, although no one has much appetite anyway. At one oclock, we head for the square. Attendance is mandatory unless you are on deaths door. This evening, officials will come around and check to see if this is the case. If not, youll be imprisoned. Its too bad, really, that they hold the reaping in the square one of the few places in District 12 that can be pleasant. The squares surrounded by shops, and on public market days, especially if theres good weather, it has a holiday feel to it. But today, despite the bright banners hanging on the buildings, theres an air of grimness. The camera crews, perched like buzzards on rooftops, only add to the effect. People file in silently and sign in. The reaping is a good opportunity for the Capitol to keep tabs on the population as well. Twelve- through eighteen-year-olds are herded into roped areas marked off by ages, the

oldest in the front, the young ones, like Prim, toward the back. Family members line up around the perimeter, holding tightly to one anothers hands. But there are others, too, who have no one they love at stake, or who no longer care, who slip among the crowd, taking bets on the two kids whose names will be drawn. Odds are

given on their ages, whether theyre Seam or merchant, if they will break down and weep. Most refuse dealing with the racketeers but carefully, carefully. These same people tend to be informers, and who hasnt broken the law? I could be shot on a daily basis for hunting, but the appetites of those in charge protect me. Not everyone can claim the same. Anyway, Gale and I agree that if we have to choose between dying of hunger and a bullet in the head, the bullet would be much quicker. The space gets tighter, more claustrophobic as people arrive. The squares quite large, but not enough to hold District 12s population of about eight thousand. Latecomers are directed to the adjacent streets, where they can watch the event on screens as its televised live by the state. I find myself standing in a clump of sixteens from the Seam. We all exchange terse nods then focus our attention on the temporary stage that is set up before the Justice Building. It holds three chairs, a podium, and two large glass balls, one for the boys and one for the girls. I stare at the paper slips in the girls ball. Twenty of them have Katniss Everdeen written on them in careful handwriting. Two of the three chairs fill with Madges father, Mayor Undersee, whos a tall, balding man, and Effie Trinket, District 12s escort, fresh from the Capitol with her scary white grin, pinkish hair, and spring green suit. They murmur to each other and then look with concern at the empty seat. Just as the town clock strikes two, the mayor steps up to the podium and begins to read. Its the same story every year. He tells of the history of Panem, the country that rose up out of the ashes of a place that was once called North America. He lists the disasters, the droughts, the storms, the fires, the encroaching seas that swallowed up so much of the land, the brutal war for what little sustenance remained. The result was Panem, a shining Capitol ringed by thirteen districts, which brought peace and prosperity to its citizens. Then came the Dark Days, the uprising of the districts against the Capitol. Twelve were defeated, the thirteenth obliterated. The Treaty of Treason gave us the new laws to guarantee peace and, as our yearly reminder that the Dark Days must never be repeated, it gave us the Hunger Games. The rules of the Hunger Games are simple. In punishment for the uprising, each of the twelve districts must provide one girl and one boy, called tributes, to participate. The twenty-four tributes will be imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold anything from a burning desert to a frozen wasteland. Over a period of several weeks, the competitors must fight to the death.

The last tribute standing wins. Taking the kids from our districts, forcing them to kill one another while we watch this is the Capitols way of reminding us how totally we are at their mercy. How little chance we would stand of surviving another rebellion. Whatever words they use, the real message is clear. Look how we take your children and sacrifice them and theres nothing you can do. If you lift a finger, we will destroy every last one of you. Just as we did in District Thirteen. To make it humiliating as well as torturous, the Capitol requires us to treat the Hunger Games as a festivity, a sporting event pitting every district against the others. The last tribute alive receives a life of ease back home, and their district will be showered with prizes, largely consisting of food. All year, the Capitol will show the winning district gifts of grain and oil and even delicacies like sugar while the rest of us battle starvation. It is both a time for repentance and a time for thanks, intones the mayor. Then he reads the list of past District 12 victors. In seventy-four years, we have had exactly two. Only one is still alive. Haymitch Abernathy, a paunchy, middle-aged man, who at this moment appears hollering something unintelligible, staggers onto the stage, and falls into the third chair. Hes drunk. Very. The crowd responds with its token applause, but hes confused and tries to give Effie Trinket a big hug, which she barely manages to fend off. The mayor looks distressed. Since all of this is being televised, right now District 12 is the laughingstock of Panem, and he knows it. He quickly tries to pull the attention back to the reaping by introducing Effie Trinket. Bright and bubbly as ever, Effie Trinket trots to the podium and gives her signature, Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor! Her pink hair must be a wig because her curls have shifted slightly off-center since her encounter with Haymitch. She goes on a bit about what an honor it is to be here, although everyone knows shes just aching to get bumped up to a better district where they have proper victors, not drunks who molest you in front of the entire nation. Through the crowd, I spot Gale looking back at me with a ghost of a smile. As reapings go, this one at least has a slight entertainment factor. But suddenly I am thinking of Gale and his forty-two names in that big glass ball and how the odds are not in his favor. Not compared to a lot of the boys. And maybe hes thinking the same thing about me because his face darkens and he turns away. But there are still thousands of slips, I wish I could whisper to him. Its time for the drawing. Effie Trinket says as she always does, Ladies first! and crosses to

the glass ball with the girls names. She reaches in, digs her hand deep into the ball, and pulls out a slip of paper. The crowd draws in a collective breath and then you can hear a pin drop, and Im feeling nauseous and so desperately hoping that its not me, that its

not me, that its not me. Effie Trinket crosses back to the podium, smoothes the slip of paper, and reads out the name in a clear voice. And its not me. Its Primrose Everdeen.

2.

One time, when I was in a blind in a tree, waiting motionless for game to wander by, I dozed off and fell ten feet to the ground, landing on my back. It was as if the impact had knocked every wisp of air from my lungs, and I lay there struggling to inhale, to exhale, to do anything. Thats how I feel now, trying to remember how to breathe, unable to speak, totally stunned as the name bounces around the inside of my skull. Someone is gripping my arm, a boy from the Seam, and I think maybe I started to fall and he caught me. There must have been some mistake. This cant be happening. Prim was one slip of paper in thousands! Her chances of being chosen so remote that Id not even bothered to worry about her. Hadnt I done everything? Taken the tesserae, refused to let her do the same? One slip. One slip in thousands. The odds had been entirely in her favor. But it hadnt mattered. Somewhere far away, I can hear the crowd murmuring unhappily as they always do when a twelve-year-old gets chosen because no one thinks this is fair. And then I see her, the blood drained from her face, hands clenched in fists at her sides, walking with stiff, small steps up toward the stage, passing me, and I see the back of her blouse has become untucked and hangs out over her skirt. Its this detail, the untucked blouse forming a ducktail, that brings me back to myself. Prim! The strangled cry comes out of my throat, and my muscles begin to move again. Prim! I dont need to shove through the crowd. The other kids make way immediately allowing me a straight path to the stage. I reach her just as she is about to mount the steps. With one sweep of my arm, I push her behind me. I volunteer! I gasp. I volunteer as tribute! Theres some confusion on the stage.

District 12 hasnt had a volunteer in decades and the protocol has become rusty. The rule is that once a tributes name has been pulled from the ball, another eligible boy, if a boys name has been read, or girl, if a girls name has been read, can step forward to take his or her place. In some districts, in which winning the reaping is such a great honor, people are eager to risk their lives, the volunteering is complicated. But in District 12, where the word tribute is pretty much synonymous with the word corpse, volunteers are all but extinct. Lovely! says Effie Trinket. But I believe theres a small matter of introducing the reaping winner and then asking for volunteers, and if one does come forth then we, um . . . She trails off, unsure herself. What does it matter? says the mayor. Hes looking at me with a pained expression on his face. He doesnt know me really, but theres a faint recognition there. I am the girl who brings the strawberries. The girl his daughter might have spoken of on occasion. The girl who five years ago stood huddled with her mother and

sister, as he presented her, the oldest child, with a medal of valor. A medal for her father, vaporized in the mines. Does he remember that? What does it matter? he repeats gruffly. Let her come forward. Prim is screaming hysterically behind me. Shes wrapped her skinny arms around me like a vice. No, Katniss! No! You cant go! Prim, let go, I say harshly, because this is upsetting me and I dont want to cry. When they televise the replay of the reapings tonight, everyone will make note of my tears, and Ill be marked as an easy target. A weakling. I will give no one that satisfaction. Let go! I can feel someone pulling her from my back. I turn and see Gale has lifted Prim off the ground and shes thrashing in his arms. Up you go, Catnip, he says, in a voice hes fighting to keep steady, and then he carries Prim off toward my mother. I steel myself and climb the steps. Well, bravo! gushes Effie Trinket. Thats the spirit of the Games! Shes pleased to finally have a district with a little action going on in it. Whats your name? I swallow hard. Katniss Everdeen, I say. I bet my buttons that was your sister. Dont want her to steal all the glory, do we? Come on, everybody! Lets give a big round of applause to our newest tribute! trills Effie Trinket. To the everlasting credit of the people of District 12, not one person claps. Not even the ones holding betting slips, the ones who are usually beyond caring. Possibly because they know me from the Hob, or knew my father, or have encountered Prim, who no

one can help loving. So instead of acknowledging applause, I stand there unmoving while they take part in the boldest form of dissent they can manage. Silence. Which says we do not agree. We do not condone. All of this is wrong. Then something unexpected happens. At least, I dont expect it because I dont think of District 12 as a place that cares about me. But a shift has occurred since I stepped up to take Prims place, and now it seems I have become someone precious. At first one, then another, then almost every member of the crowd touches the three middle fingers of their left hand to their lips and holds it out to me. It is an old and rarely used gesture of our district, occasionally seen at funerals. It means thanks, it means admiration, it means good-bye to someone you love. Now I am truly in danger of crying, but fortunately Haymitch chooses this time to come staggering across the stage to congratulate me. Look at her. Look at this one! he hollers, throwing an arm around my shoulders. Hes surprisingly strong for such a wreck. I like her! His breath reeks of liquor and its been a long time since hes bathed. Lots of . . . He cant think of the word for a while. Spunk! he says triumphantly. More than you! he releases me and starts for the front of the stage. More than you! he shouts, pointing directly into a

camera. Is he addressing the audience or is he so drunk he might actually be taunting the Capitol? Ill never know because just as hes opening his mouth

to continue, Haymitch plummets off the stage and knocks himself unconscious. Hes disgusting, but Im grateful. With every camera gleefully trained on him, I have just enough time to release the small, choked sound in my throat and compose myself. I put my hands behind my back and stare into the distance. I can see the hills I climbed this morning with Gale. For a moment, I yearn for something . . . The idea of us leaving the district . . . Making our way in the woods . . . But I know I was right about not running off. Because who else would have volunteered for Prim? Haymitch is whisked away on a stretcher, and Effie Trinket is trying to get the ball rolling again. What an exciting day! she warbles as she attempts to straighten her wig, which has listed severely to the right. But more excitement to come! Its time to choose our boy tribute! Clearly hoping to contain her tenuous hair situation, she plants one hand on her head as she crosses to the ball that contains the boys names and grabs the first slip she encounters. She zips back to the podium, and I dont even have time to wish

for Gales safety when shes reading the name. Peeta Mellark. Peeta Mellark! Oh, no, I think. Not him. Because I recognize this name, although I have never spoken directly to its owner. Peeta Mellark. No, the odds are not in my favor today. I watch him as he makes his way toward the stage. Medium height, stocky build, ashy blond hair that falls in waves over his forehead. The shock of the moment is registering on his face, you can see his struggle to remain emotionless, but his blue eyes show the alarm Ive seen so often in prey. Yet he climbs steadily onto the stage and takes his place. Effie Trinket asks for volunteers, but no one steps forward. He has two older brothers, I know, Ive seen them in the bakery, but one is probably too old now to volunteer and the other wont. This is standard. Family devotion only goes so far for most people on reaping day. What I did was the radical thing. The mayor begins to read the long, dull Treaty of Treason as he does every year at this point its required but Im not listening to a word. Why him? I think. Then I try to convince myself it doesnt matter. Peeta Mellark and I are not friends. Not even neighbors. We dont speak. Our only real interaction happened years ago. Hes probably forgotten it. But I havent and I know I never will. . . . It was during the worst time. My father had been

killed in the mine accident three months earlier in the bitterest January anyone could remember. The numbness of his loss had passed, and the pain would hit me out of nowhere, doubling me over, racking my body with sobs. Where are you? I would cry out in my mind. Where have you gone? Of course, there was never any answer. The district had given us a small amount of money as compensation for his death, enough to cover one month of grieving at which time my mother would be expected to get a job. Only she didnt. She didnt do anything but sit propped up in a

chair or, more often, huddled under the blankets on her bed, eyes fixed on some point in the distance. Once in a while, shed stir, get up as if moved by some urgent purpose, only to then collapse back into stillness. No amount of pleading from Prim seemed to affect her. I was terrified. I suppose now that my mother was locked in some dark world of sadness, but at the time, all I knew was that I had lost not only a father, but a mother as well. At eleven years old, with Prim just seven, I took over as head of the family. There was no choice. I bought our food at the market and cooked it as best I could and tried to keep Prim and myself looking presentable.

Because if it had become known that my mother could no longer care for us, the district would have taken us away from her and placed us in the community home. Id grown up seeing those home kids at school. The sadness, the marks of angry hands on their faces, the hopelessness that curled their shoulders forward. I could never let that happen to Prim. Sweet, tiny Prim who cried when I cried before she even knew the reason, who brushed and plaited my mothers hair before we left for school, who still polished my fathers shaving mirror each night because hed hated the layer of coal dust that settled on everything in the Seam. The community home would crush her like a bug. So I kept our predicament a secret. But the money ran out and we were slowly starving to death. Theres no other way to put it. I kept telling myself if I could only hold out until May, just May 8th, I would turn twelve and be able to sign up for the tesserae and get that precious grain and oil to feed us. Only there were still several weeks to go. We could well be dead by then. Starvations not an uncommon fate in District 12. Who hasnt seen the victims? Older people who cant work. Children from a family with too many to feed. Those injured in the mines. Straggling through the streets. And one day, you come upon them sitting motionless against a wall or

lying in the Meadow, you hear the wails from a house, and the Peacekeepers are called in to retrieve the body. Starvation is never the cause of death officially. Its always the flu, or exposure, or pneumonia. But that fools no one. On the afternoon of my encounter with Peeta Mellark, the rain was falling in relentless icy sheets. I had been in town, trying to trade some threadbare old baby clothes of Prims in the public market, but there were no takers. Although I had been to the Hob on several occasions with my father, I was too frightened to venture into that rough, gritty place alone. The rain had soaked through my fathers hunting jacket, leaving me chilled to the bone. For three days, wed had nothing but boiled water with some old dried mint leaves Id found in the back of a cupboard. By the time the market closed, I was shaking so hard I dropped my bundle of baby clothes in a mud puddle. I didnt pick it up for fear I would keel over and be unable to regain my feet. Besides, no one

wanted those clothes. I couldnt go home. Because at home was my mother with her dead eyes and my little sister, with her hollow cheeks and cracked lips. I couldnt walk into that room with the smoky fire from the damp branches I had scavenged at

the edge of the woods after the coal had run out, my bands empty of any hope. I found myself stumbling along a muddy lane behind the shops that serve the wealthiest townspeople. The merchants live above their businesses, so I was essentially in their backyards. I remember the outlines of garden beds not yet planted for the spring, a goat or two in a pen, one sodden dog tied to a post, hunched defeated in the muck. All forms of stealing are forbidden in District 12. Punishable by death. But it crossed my mind that there might be something in the trash bins, and those were fair game. Perhaps a bone at the butchers or rotted vegetables at the grocers, something no one but my family was desperate enough to eat. Unfortunately, the bins had just been emptied. When I passed the bakers, the smell of fresh bread was so overwhelming I felt dizzy. The ovens were in the back, and a golden glow spilled out the open kitchen door. I stood mesmerized by the heat and the luscious scent until the rain interfered, running its icy fingers down my back, forcing me back to life. I lifted the lid to the bakers trash bin and found it spotlessly, heartlessly bare. Suddenly a voice was screaming at me and I looked up to see the bakers wife, telling me to move on and did I want her to call the Peacekeepers and

how sick she was of having those brats from the Seam pawing through her trash. The words were ugly and I had no defense. As I carefully replaced the lid and backed away, I noticed him, a boy with blond hair peering out from behind his mothers back. Id seen him at school. He was in my year, but I didnt know his name. He stuck with the town kids, so how would I? His mother went back into the bakery, grumbling, but he must have been watching me as I made my way behind the pen that held their pig and leaned against the far side of an old apple tree. The realization that Id have nothing to take home had finally sunk in. My knees buckled and I slid down the tree trunk to its roots. It was too much. I was too sick and weak and tired, oh, so tired. Let them call the Peacekeepers and take us to the community home, I thought. Or better yet, let me die right here in the rain. There was a clatter in the bakery and I heard the woman screaming again and the sound of a blow, and I vaguely wondered what was going on. Feet sloshed toward me through the mud and I thought, Its her. Shes coming to drive me away with a stick. But it wasnt her. It was the boy. In his arms, he carried two large loaves of bread that must have fallen into the fire because the crusts were scorched black. His mother was yelling, Feed it to the pig, you stupid creature!

Why not? No one decent will buy burned bread! He began to tear off chunks from the burned parts and

toss them into the trough, and the front bakery bell rung and the mother disappeared to help a customer. The boy never even glanced my way, but I was watching him. Because of the bread, because of the red weal that stood out on his cheekbone. What had she hit him with? My parents never hit us. I couldnt even imagine it. The boy took one look back to the bakery as if checking that the coast was clear, then, his attention back on the pig, he threw a loaf of bread in my direction. The second quickly followed, and he sloshed back to the bakery, closing the kitchen door tightly behind him. I stared at the loaves in disbelief. They were fine, perfect really, except for the burned areas. Did he mean for me to have them? He must have. Because there they were at my feet. Before anyone could witness what had happened I shoved the loaves up under my shirt, wrapped the hunting jacket tightly about me, and walked swiftly away. The heat of the bread burned into my skin, but I clutched it tighter, clinging to life. By the time I reached home, the loaves had cooled somewhat,

but the insides were still warm. When I dropped them on the table, Prims hands reached to tear off a chunk, but I made her sit, forced my mother to join us at the table, and poured warm tea. I scraped off the black stuff and sliced the bread. We ate an entire loaf, slice by slice. It was good hearty bread, filled with raisins and nuts. I put my clothes to dry at the fire, crawled into bed, and fell into a dreamless sleep. It didnt occur to me until the next morning that the boy might have burned the bread on purpose. Might have dropped the loaves into the flames, knowing it meant being punished, and then delivered them to me. But I dismissed this. It must have been an accident. Why would he have done it? He didnt even know me. Still, just throwing me the bread was an enormous kindness that would have surely resulted in a beating if discovered. 1 couldnt explain his actions. We ate slices of bread for breakfast and headed to school. It was as if spring had come overnight. Warm sweet air. Fluffy clouds. At school, I passed the boy in the hall, his cheek had swelled up and his eye had blackened. He was with his friends and didnt acknowledge me in any way. But as I collected Prim and started for home that afternoon, I found him staring at me from across the school yard. Our eyes met for only a second, then he turned his head

away. I dropped my gaze, embarrassed, and thats when I saw it. The first dandelion of the year. A bell went off in my head. I thought of the hours spent in the woods with my father and I knew how we were going to survive. To this day, I can never shake the connection between this boy, Peeta Mellark, and the bread that gave me hope, and the dandelion that reminded me that I was not doomed. And more than once, I have turned in the school hallway and caught his eyes trained on me, only to quickly flit away. I feel like I owe him something, and I hate owing people. Maybe if I

had thanked him at some point, Id be feeling less conflicted now. I thought about it a couple of times, but the opportunity never seemed to present itself. And now it never will. Because were going to be thrown into an arena to fight to the death. Exactly how am I supposed to work in a thank-you in there? Somehow it just wont seem sincere if Im trying to slit his throat. The mayor finishes the dreary Treaty of Treason and motions for Peeta and me to shake hands. His are as solid and warm as those loaves of bread. Peeta looks me right in the eye and gives my hand what I think is meant to be a reassuring squeeze. Maybe its just a nervous spasm. We turn back to

face the crowd as the anthem of Panem plays. Oh, well, I think. There will be twenty-four of us. Odds are someone else will kill him before I do. Of course, the odds have not been very dependable of late.

3.

The moment the anthem ends, we are taken into custody. I dont mean were handcuffed or anything, but a group of Peacekeepers marches us through the front door of the Justice Building. Maybe tributes have tried to escape in the past. Ive never seen that happen though. Once inside, Im conducted to a room and left alone. Its the richest place Ive ever been in, with thick, deep carpets and a velvet couch and chairs. I know velvet because my mother has a dress with a collar made of the stuff. When I sit on the couch, I cant help running my fingers over the fabric repeatedly. It helps to calm me as I try to prepare for the next hour. The time allotted for the tributes to say goodbye to their loved ones. I cannot afford to get upset, to leave this room with puffy eyes and a red nose. Crying is not an option. There will be more

cameras at the train station. My sister and my mother come first. I reach out to Primand she climbs on my lap, her arms around my neck, headon my shoulder, just like she did when she was a toddler. My mother sits beside me and wraps her arms around us. For a few minutes, we say nothing. Then I start telling themall the things they must remember to do, now that I will not be there to do them for them. Prim is not to take any tesserae. They can get by, iftheyre careful, on selling Prims goat milk and cheese and the small apothecary business my mother now runs for the people in the Seam. Gale will get her the herbs she doesnt grow herself, but she must be very careful to describe them because hes not as familiar with them as I am. Hell also bring them game he and I made a pact about this a year or so ago and will probably not ask for compensation, but they should thank him with some kind of trade, like milk or medicine. I dont bother suggesting Prim learn to hunt. I tried to teach her a couple of times and it was disastrous. The woods terrified her, and whenever I shot something, shed get teary and talk about how we might be able to heal it if we got it home soon enough. But she makes out well with her goat, so I concentrate on that. When I am done with instructions about fuel,


and trading, and staying in school, I turn to my mother and grip her arm, hard. Listen to me. Are you listening to me? She nods, alarmed by my intensity. She must know whats coming. You cant leave again, I say. My mothers eyes find the floor. I know. I wont. I couldnt help what Well, you have to help it this time. You cant clock out and leave Prim on her own. Theres no me now to keep you both alive. It doesnt matter what happens. Whatever you see on the screen. You have to promise me youll fight through it! My voice has risen to a shout. In it is all the anger, all the fear I felt at her abandonment. She pulls her arm from my grasp, moved to anger herself now. I was ill. I could have treated myself if Id had the medicine I have now. That part about her being ill might be true. Ive seen her bring back people suffering from immobilizing sadness since. Perhaps it is a sickness, but its one we cant afford. Then take it. And take care of her! I say. Ill be all right, Katniss, says Prim, clasping my face in her hands. But you have to take care, too. Youre so fast and brave. Maybe you can win. I cant win. Prim must know that in her heart. The competition will be far beyond my abilities. Kids from wealthier districts, where winning is a huge honor, whove been trained their whole lives for this. Boys who are two to three times my size. Girls

who know twenty different ways to kill you with a knife. Oh, therell be people like me, too. People to weed out before the real fun begins. Maybe, I say, because I can hardly tell my mother to carry on if Ive already given up myself. Besides, it isnt in my nature to go down without a fight, even when things seem insurmountable. Then wed be rich as Haymitch. I dont care if were rich. I just want you to come home. You will try, wont you? Really, really try? asks Prim. Really, really try. I swear it, I say. And I know, because of Prim, Ill have to. And then the Peacekeeper is at the door, signaling our time is up, and were all hugging one another so hard it hurts and all Im saying is I love you. I love you both. And theyre saying it back and then the Peacekeeper orders them out and the door closes. I bury my head in one of the velvet pillows as if this can block the whole thing out. Someone else enters the room, and when I look up, Im surprised to see its the baker, Peeta Mellarks father. I cant believe hes come to visit me. After all, Ill be trying to kill his son soon. But we do know each other a bit, and he knows Prim even better. When she sells her goat cheeses at the Hob, she puts two of them aside for him and he gives her a generous amount of bread in return. We always wait to trade with him when his witch of a wife

isnt around because hes so much nicer. I feel certain he would never have hit his son the way she did over the burned bread. But why has he come to see me? The baker sits awkwardly on the edge of one of the plush chairs. Hes a big, broad-shouldered man with burn scars from years at the ovens. He must

have just said goodbye to his son. He pulls a white paper package from his jacket pocket and holds it out to me. I open it and find cookies. These are a luxury we can never afford. Thank you, I say. The bakers not a very talkative man in the best of times, and today he has no words at all. I had some of your bread this morning. My friend Gale gave you a squirrel for it. He nods, as if remembering the squirrel. Not your best trade, I say. He shrugs as if it couldnt possibly matter. Then I cant think of anything else, so we sit in silence until a Peacemaker summons him. He rises and coughs to clear his throat. Ill keep an eye on the little girl. Make sure shes eating. I feel some of the pressure in my chest lighten at his words. People deal with me, but they are genuinely fond of Prim. Maybe there will be enough fondness to keep her alive. My next guest is also unexpected. Madge walks straight to me. She is not weepy

or evasive, instead theres an urgency about her tone that surprises me. They let you wear one thing from your district in the arena. One thing to remind you of home. Will you wear this? She holds out the circular gold pin that was on her dress earlier. I hadnt paid much attention to it before, but now I see its a small bird in flight. Your pin? I say. Wearing a token from my district is about the last thing on my mind. Here, Ill put it on your dress, all right? Madge doesnt wait for an answer, she just leans in and fixes the bird to my dress. Promise youll wear it into the arena, Katniss? she asks. Promise? Yes, I say. Cookies. A pin. Im getting all kinds of gifts today. Madge gives me one more. A kiss on the cheek. Then shes gone and Im left thinking that maybe Madge really has been my friend all along. Finally, Gale is here and maybe there is nothing romantic between us, but when he opens his arms I dont hesitate to go into them. His body is familiar to me the way it moves, the smell of wood smoke, even the sound of his heart beating I know from quiet moments on a hunt but this is the first time I really feel it, lean and hard-muscled against my own. Listen, he says. Getting a knife should be pretty easy, but youve got to get your hands on a bow. Thats your best chance. They dont always have bows, I say, thinking of the

year there were only horrible spiked maces that the tributes had to bludgeon one another to death with. Then make one, says Gale. Even a weak bow is better than no bow at all. I have tried copying my fathers bows with poor results. Its not that easy. Even he had to scrap his own work sometimes. I dont even know if therell be wood, I say. Another year, they tossed everybody into a landscape of nothing but boulders and sand and scruffy bushes. I particularly hated that year. Many contestants were bitten by venomous snakes or went insane from thirst. Theres almost always some wood, Gale says. Since that year half of them died of cold. Not much entertainment in that. Its true. We spent one Hunger Games watching the

players freeze to death at night. You could hardly see them because they were just huddled in balls and had no wood for fires or torches or anything. It was considered very anti-climactic in the Capitol, all those quiet, bloodless deaths. Since then, theres usually been wood to make fires. Yes, theres usually some, I say. Katniss, its just hunting. Youre the best hunter I know, says Gale. Its not just hunting. Theyre armed. They think, I say. So do you. And youve had more practice. Real

practice, he says. You know how to kill. Not people, I say. How different can it be, really? says Gale grimly. The awful thing is that if I can forget theyre people, it will be no different at all. The Peacekeepers are back too soon and Gale asks for more time, but theyre taking him away and I start to panic. Dont let them starve! I cry out, clinging to his hand. I wont! You know I wont! Katniss, remember I he says, and they yank us apart and slam the door and Ill never know what it was he wanted me to remember. Its a short ride from the Justice Building to the train station. Ive never been in a car before. Rarely even ridden in wagons. In the Seam, we travel on foot. Ive been right not to cry. The station is swarming with reporters with their insectlike cameras trained directly on my face. But Ive had a lot of practice at wiping my face clean of emotions and I do this now. I catch a glimpse of myself on the television screen on the wall thats airing my arrival live and feel gratified that I appear almost bored. Peeta Mellark, on the other hand, has obviously been crying and interestingly enough does not seem to be trying to cover it up. I immediately wonder if this will be his strategy in the Games. To appear weak and frightened, to reassure the other tributes that he is no competition at all, and then come out fighting. This worked very

well for a girl, Johanna Mason, from District 7 a few years back. She seemed like such a sniveling, cowardly fool that no one bothered about her until there were only a handful of contestants left. It turned out she could kill viciously. Pretty clever, the way she played it. But this seems an odd strategy for Peeta Mellark because hes a bakers son. All those years of having enough to eat and hauling bread trays around have made him broad-shouldered and strong. It will take an awful lot of weeping to convince anyone to overlook him. We have to stand for a few minutes in the doorway of the train while the cameras gobble up our images, then were allowed inside and the doors close mercifully behind us. The train begins to move at once. The speed initially takes my breath away. Of course, Ive never been on a train, as travel between the districts is forbidden except for officially sanctioned duties. For us, thats mainly transporting coal. But this is no ordinary coal train. Its one of the high-speed Capitol models that average 250 miles per hour. Our journey to the Capitol will take less than a day. In school, they tell us the Capitol

was built in a place once called the Rockies. District 12 was in a region known is

Appalachia. Even hundreds of years ago, they mined coal here. Which is why our miners have to dig so deep. Somehow it all comes back to coal at school. Besides basic reading and math most of our instruction is coal-related. Except for the weekly lecture on the history of Panem. Its mostly a lot of blather about what we owe the Capitol. I know there must be more than theyre telling us, an actual account of what happened during the rebellion. But I dont spend much time thinking about it. Whatever the truth is, I dont see how it will help me get food on the table. The tribute train is fancier than even the room in the Justice Building. We are each given our own chambers that have a bedroom, a dressing area, and a private bathroom with hot and cold running water. We dont have hot water at home, unless we boil it. There are drawers filled with fine clothes, and Effie Trinket tells me to do anything I want, wear anything I want, everything is at my disposal. Just be ready for supper in an hour. I peel off my mothers blue dress and take a hot shower. Ive never had a shower before. Its like being in a summer rain, only warmer. I dress in a dark green shirt and pants. At the last minute, I remember Madges little gold pin. For the first time, I get a good look at it. Its as if someone fashioned a small golden bird and then attached a ring

around it. The bird is connected to the ring only by its wing tips. I suddenly recognize it. A mocking jay. Theyre funny birds and something of a slap in the face to the Capitol. During the rebellion, the Capitol bred a series of genetically altered animals as weapons. The common term for them was muttations, or sometimes mutts for short. One was a special bird called a jabber jay that had the ability to memorize and repeat whole human conversations. They were homing birds, exclusively male, that were released into regions where the Capitols enemies were known to be hiding. After the birds gathered words, theyd fly back to centers to be recorded. It took people awhile to realize what was going on in the districts, how private conversations were being transmitted. Then, of course, the rebels fed the Capitol endless lies, and the joke was on it. So the centers were shut down and the birds were abandoned to die off in the wild. Only they didnt die off. Instead, the jabber jays mated with female mockingbirds creating a whole new species that could replicate both bird whistles and human melodies. They had lost the ability to enunciate words but could still mimic a range of human vocal sounds, from a childs high-pitched warble to a mans deep tones. And they could re-create songs. Not just a few notes, but whole songs

with multiple verses, if you had the patience to sing them and if they liked your voice. My father was particularly fond of mockingjays. When we went hunting, he would whistle or sing complicated songs to them and, after a polite

pause, theyd always sing back. Not everyone is treated with such respect. But whenever my father sang, all the birds in the area would fall silent and listen. His voice was that beautiful, high and clear and so filled with life it made you want to laugh and cry at the same time. I could never bring myself to continue the practice after he was gone. Still, theres something comforting about the little bird. Its like having a piece of my father with me, protecting me. I fasten the pin onto my shirt, and with the dark green fabric as a background, I can almost imagine the mockingjay flying through the trees. Effie Trinket comes to collect me for supper. I follow her through the narrow, rocking corridor into a dining room with polished paneled walls. Theres a table where all the dishes are highly breakable. Peeta Mellark sits waiting for us, the chair next to him empty. Wheres Haymitch? asks Effie Trinket brightly. Last time I saw him, he said he was going to take a nap, says Peeta. Well, its been an

exhausting day, says Effie Trinket. I think shes relieved by Haymitchs absence, and who can blame her? The supper comes in courses. A thick carrot soup, green salad, lamb chops and mashed potatoes, cheese and fruit, a chocolate cake. Throughout the meal, Effie Trinket keeps reminding us to save space because theres more to come. But Im stuffing myself because Ive never had food like this, so good and so much, and because probably the best thing I can do between now and the Games is put on a few pounds. At least, you two have decent manners, says Effie as were finishing the main course. The pair last year ate everything with their hands like a couple of savages. It completely upset my digestion. The pair last year were two kids from the Seam whod never, not one day of their lives, had enough to eat. And when they did have food, table manners were surely the last thing on their minds. Peetas a bakers son. My mother taught Prim and I to eat properly, so yes, I can handle a fork and knife. But I hate Effie Trinkets comment so much I make a point of eating the rest of my meal with my fingers. Then I wipe my hands on the tablecloth. This makes her purse her lips tightly together. Now that the meals over, Im fighting to keep the food down. I can see Peetas looking a little green, too. Neither of our

stomachs is used to such rich fare. But if I can hold down Greasy Saes concoction of mice meat, pig entrails, and tree bark a winter specialty Im determined to hang on to this. We go to another compartment to watch the recap of the reapings across Panem. They try to stagger them throughout the day so a person could conceivably watch the whole thing live, but only people in the Capitol could really do that, since none of them have to attend reapings themselves. One by one, we see the other reapings, the names called, (the volunteers stepping forward or, more often, not. We examine the faces of the kids who will be our competition. A few stand out in my mind. A

monstrous boy who lunges forward to volunteer from District 2. A fox-faced girl with sleek red hair from District 5. A boy with a crippled foot from District 10. And most hauntingly, a twelve-year-old girl from District 11. She has dark brown skin and eyes, but other than that, shes very like Prim in size and demeanor. Only when she mounts the stage and they ask for volunteers, all you can hear is the wind whistling through the decrepit buildings around her. Theres no one willing to take her place. Last of all, they show District 12. Prim being called, me running forward to

volunteer. You cant miss the desperation in my voice as I shove Prim behind me, as if Im afraid no one will hear and theyll take Prim away. But, of course, they do hear. I see Gale pulling her off me and watch myself mount the stage. The commentators are not sure what to say about the crowds refusal to applaud. The silent salute. One says that District 12 has always been a bit backward but that local customs can be charming. As if on cue, Haymitch falls off the stage, and they groan comically. Peetas name is drawn, and he quietly takes his place. We shake hands. They cut to the anthem again, and the pro-gram ends. Effie Trinket is disgruntled about the state her wig was in. Your mentor has a lot to learn about presentation. A lot about televised behavior. Peeta unexpectedly laughs. He was drunk, says Peeta. Hes drunk every year. Every day, I add. I cant help smirking a little. Effie Trinket makes it sound like Haymitch just has somewhat rough manners that could be corrected with a few tips from her. Yes, hisses Effie Trinket. How odd you two find it amusing. You know your mentor is your lifeline to the world in these Games. The one who advises you, lines up your sponsors, and dictates the presentation of any gifts. Haymitch can well be the difference between your life and your death! Just then,

Haymitch staggers into the compartment. I miss supper? he says in a slurred voice. Then he vomits all over the expensive carpet and falls in the mess. So laugh away! says Effie Trinket. She hops in her pointy shoes around the pool of vomit and flees the room.

4.

For a few moments, Peeta and I take in the scene of our mentor trying to rise out of the slippery vile stuff from his stomach. The reek of vomit and raw spirits almost brings my dinner up. We exchange a glance. Obviously Haymitch isnt much, but Effie Trinket is right about one thing, once were in the arena hes all weve got. As if by some unspoken agreement, Peeta and I each take one of Haymitchs arms and help him to his feet. I tripped? Haymitch asks. Smells bad. He wipes his hand on his nose, smearing his face with vomit. Lets get you back to your room, says Peeta. Clean you up a bit. We half-lead half-carry Haymitch back to his compartment. Since we cant exactly set him down on the embroidered bedspread, we haul him into the bathtub

and turn the shower on him. He hardly notices. Its okay, Peeta says to me. Ill take it from here. I cant

help feeling a little grateful since the last thing I want to do is strip down Haymitch, wash the vomit out of his chest hair, and tuck him into bed. Possibly Peeta is trying to make a good impression on him, to be his favorite once the Games begin. But judging by the state hes in, Haymitch will have no memory of this tomorrow. All right, I say. I can send one of the Capitol people to help you. Theres any number on the train. Cooking for us. Waiting on us. Guarding us. Taking care of us is their job. No. I dont want them, says Peeta. I nod and head to my own room. I understand how Peeta feels. I cant stand the sight of the Capitol people myself. But making them deal with Haymitch might be a small form of revenge. So Im pondering the reason why he insists on taking care of Haymitch and all of a sudden I think, Its because hes being kind. Just as he was kind to give me the bread. The idea pulls me up short. A kind Peeta Mellark is far more dangerous to me than an unkind one. Kind people have a way of working their way inside me and rooting there. And I cant let Peeta do this.

Not where were going. So I decide, from this moment on, to have as little as possible to do with the bakers son. When I get back to my room, the train is pausing at a platform to refuel. I quickly open the window, toss the cookies Peetas father gave me out of the train, and slam the glass shut. No more. No more of either of them. Unfortunately, the packet of cookies hits the ground and bursts open in a patch of dandelions by the track. I only see the image for a moment, because the train is off again, but its enough. Enough to remind me of that other dandelion in the school yard years ago . . . I had just turned away from Peeta Mellarks bruised face when I saw the dandelion and I knew hope wasnt lost. I plucked it carefully and hurried home. I grabbed a bucket and Prims hand and headed to the Meadow and yes, it was dotted with the golden-headed weeds. After wed harvested those, we scrounged along inside the fence for probably a mile until wed filled the bucket with the dandelion greens, stems, and flowers. That night, we gorged ourselves on dandelion salad and the rest of the bakery bread. What else? Prim asked me. What other food can we find? All kinds of things, I promised her. I just have to remember them. My mother had a book shed brought with her from the apothecary shop. The pages were

made of old parchment and covered in ink drawings of plants. Neat handwritten blocks told their names, where to gather them, when they came in bloom, their medical uses. But my father added other entries to the book. Plants for eating, not healing. Dandelions, pokeweed, wild onions, pines. Prim and I spent the rest of the night poring over those pages. The next day, we were off school. For a while I hung around the edges of the Meadow, but finally I worked up the courage to go under the fence. It was the first time Id been there alone, without my fathers weapons to protect me. But I

retrieved the small bow and arrows hed made me from a hollow tree. I probably didnt go more than twenty yards into the woods that day. Most of the time, I perched up in the branches of an old oak, hoping for game to come by. After several hours, I had the good luck to kill a rabbit. Id shot a few rabbits before, with my fathers guidance. But this Id done on my own. We hadnt had meat in months. The sight of the rabbit seemed to stir something in my mother. She roused herself, skinned the carcass, and made a stew with the meat and some more greens Prim had

gathered. Then she acted confused and went back to bed, but when the stew was done, we made her eat a bowl. The woods became our savior, and each day I went a bit farther into its arms. It was slow-going at first, but I was determined to feed us. I stole eggs from nests, caught fish in nets, sometimes managed to shoot a squirrel or rabbit for stew, and gathered the various plants that sprung up beneath my feet. Plants are tricky. Many are edible, but one false mouthful and youre dead. I checked and double-checked the plants I harvested with my fathers pictures. I kept us alive. Any sign of danger, a distant howl, the inexplicable break of a branch, sent me flying back to the fence at first. Then I began to risk climbing trees to escape the wild dogs that quickly got bored and moved on. Bears and cats lived deeper in, perhaps disliking the sooty reek of our district. On May 8th, I went to the Justice Building, signed up for my tesserae, and pulled home my first batch of grain and oil in Prims toy wagon. On the eighth of every month, I was entitled to do the same. I couldnt stop hunting and gathering, of course. The grain was not enough to live on, and there were other things to buy, soap and milk and thread. What we didnt absolutely have to eat, I began to trade at the Hob. It was frightening to enter that place without my

father at my side, but people had respected him, and they accepted me. Game was game after all, no matter whod shot it. I also sold at the back doors of the wealthier clients in town, trying to remember what my father had told me and learning a few new tricks as well. The butcher would buy my rabbits but not squirrels. The baker enjoyed squirrel but would only trade for one if his wife wasnt around. The Head Peacekeeper loved wild turkey. The mayor had a passion for strawberries. In late summer, I was washing up in a pond when I noticed the plants growing around me. Tall with leaves like arrowheads. Blossoms with three white petals. I knelt down in the water, my fingers digging into the soft mud, and I pulled up handfuls of the roots. Small, bluish tubers that dont look like much but boiled or baked are as good as any potato. Katniss, I said aloud. Its the plant I was named for. And I heard my fathers voice joking, As long as you can find yourself, youll never starve. I spent hours stirring up the pond bed with my toes and a stick, gathering the tubers that floated to the top.

That night, we feasted on fish and Katniss roots until we were all, for the first

time in months, full. Slowly, my mother returned to us. She began to clean and cook and preserve some of the food I brought in for winter. People traded us or paid money for her medical remedies. One day, I heard her singing. Prim was thrilled to have her back, but I kept watching, waiting for her to disappear on us again. I didnt trust her. And some small gnarled place inside me hated her for her weakness, for her neglect, for the months she had put us through. Prim forgave her, but I had taken a step back from my mother, put up a wall to protect myself from needing her, and nothing was ever the same between us again. Now I was going to die without that ever being set right. I thought of how I had yelled at her today in the Justice Building. I had told her I loved her, too, though. So maybe it would all balance out. For a while I stand staring out the train window, wishing I could open it again, but unsure of what would happen at such high speed. In the distance, I see the lights of another district. 7? 10? I dont know. I think about the people in their houses, settling in for bed. I imagine my home, with its shutters drawn tight. What are they doing now, my mother and Prim? Were they able to eat supper? The fish stew and the strawberries? Or did it lay untouched on their plates? Did they watch the recap of the days events on the battered old TV that sits on the table against the wall? Surely, there were more tears. Is my mother holding up, being strong for Prim? Or has she already started to slip away, leaving the weight of the world on my sisters fragile shoulders? Prim will undoubtedly sleep with my mother tonight. The thought of that scruffy old Buttercup posting himself on the bed to watch over Prim comforts me. If she cries, he will nose his way into her arms and curl up there until she calms down and falls asleep. Im so glad I didnt drown him. Imagining my home makes me ache with loneliness. This day has been endless. Could Gale and I have been eating blackberries only this morning? It seems like a lifetime ago. Like a long dream that deteriorated into a nightmare. Maybe, if I go to sleep, I will wake up back in District 12, where I belong. Probably the drawers hold any number of nightgowns, but I just strip off my shirt and pants and climb into bed in my underwear. The sheets are made of soft, silky fabric. A thick fluffy comforter gives immediate warmth. If Im going to cry, now is the time to do it. By morning, Ill be able to wash the damage done by the tears from my face. But no tears come. Im too tired or too numb to cry. The only thing I feel is a desire to be somewhere else. So I let the train rock me into oblivion. Gray light is leaking through

the curtains when the rapping rouses me. I hear Effie Trinkets voice, calling me to rise. Up, up, up! Its going to be a big, big, big day! I try and imagine, for a moment, what it must be like inside that

womans head. What thoughts fill her waking hours? What dreams come to her at night? I have no idea. I put the green outfit back on since its not really dirty, just slightly crumpled from spending the night on the floor. My fingers trace the circle around the little gold mockingjay and I think of the woods, and of my father, and of my mother and Prim waking up, having to get on with things. I slept in the elaborate braided hair my mother did for the reaping and it doesnt look too bad, so I just leave it up. It doesnt matter. We cant be far from the Capitol now. And once we reach the city, my stylist will dictate my look for the opening ceremonies tonight anyway. I just hope I get one who doesnt think nudity is the last word in fashion. As I enter the dining car, Effie Trinket brushes by me with a cup of black coffee. Shes muttering obscenities under her breath. Haymitch, his face puffy and red from the previous days indulgences, is chuckling. Peeta holds a roll and looks somewhat embarrassed.Sit down! Sit down! says Haymitch, waving me over. The moment I slide into my chair Im served an enormous platter of food. Eggs, ham, piles of fried potatoes. A tureen of fruit sits in ice to keep it chilled. The basket of rolls they set before me would keep my family going for a week. Theres an elegant glass of orange juice. At least, I think its orange juice. Ive only even tasted an orange once, at New Years when my father bought one as a special treat. A cup of coffee. My mother adores coffee, which we could almost never afford, but it only tastes bitter and thin to me. A rich brown cup of something Ive never seen. They call it hot chocolate, says Peeta. Its good. I take a sip of the hot, sweet, creamy liquid and a shudder runs through me. Even though the rest of the meal beckons, I ignore it until Ive drained my cup. Then I stuff down every mouthful I can hold, which is a substantial amount, being careful to not overdo it on the richest stuff. One time, my mother told me that I always eat like Ill never see food again. And I said, I wont unless I bring it home. That shut her up. When my stomach feels like its about to split open, I lean back and take in my breakfast companions. Peeta is still eating, breaking off bits of roll and dipping them in hot chocolate. Haymitch hasnt paid much attention to his platter, but hes knocking

back a glass of red juice that he keeps thinning with a clear liquid from a bottle. Judging by the fumes, its some kind of spirit. I dont know Haymitch, but Ive seen him often enough in the Hob, tossing handfuls of money on the counter of the woman who sells white liquor. Hell be incoherent by the time we reach the Capitol. I realize I detest Haymitch. No wonder the District 12 tributes never stand a chance. It isnt just that weve been underfed and lack training. Some of our tributes have still been strong enough to make a go of it. But we rarely get sponsors and hes a big part of the reason why. The rich people who back tributes

either because theyre betting on them or simply for the bragging rights of picking a winner expect someone classier than Haymitch to deal with. So, youre supposed to give us advice, I say to Haymitch. Heres some advice. Stay alive, says Haymitch, and then bursts out laughing. I exchange a look with Peeta before I remember Im having nothing more to do with him. Im surprised to see the hardness in his eyes. He generally seems so mild. Thats very funny, says Peeta. Suddenly he lashes out at the glass in Haymitchs hand. It shatters on the floor, sending the bloodred liquid running toward the back of the train. Only not to us. Haymitch considers this a moment, then punches Peeta in the jaw, knocking him from his chair. When he turns back to reach for the spirits, I drive my knife into the table between his hand and the bottle, barely missing his fingers. I brace myself to deflect his hit, but it doesnt come. Instead he sits back and squints at us. Well, whats this? says Haymitch. Did I actually get a pair of fighters this year? Peeta rises from the floor and scoops up a handful of ice from under the fruit tureen. He starts to raise it to the red mark on his jaw. No, says Haymitch, stopping him. Let the bruise show. The audience will think youve mixed it up with another tribute before youve even made it to the arena. Thats against the rules, says Peeta. Only if they catch you. That bruise will say you fought, you werent caught, even better, says Haymitch. He turns to me. Can you hit anything with that knife besides a table? The bow and arrow is my weapon. But Ive spent a fair amount of time throwing knives as well. Sometimes, if Ive wounded an animal with an arrow, its better to get a knife into it, too, before I approach it. I realize that if I want Haymitchs attention, this is my moment to make an impression. I yank the knife out of the table, get a grip on the blade, and then throw it into the wall

across the room. I was actually just hoping to get a good solid stick, but it lodges in the seam between two panels, making me look a lot better than I am. Stand over here. Both of you, says Haymitch, nodding to the middle of the room. We obey and he circles us, prodding us like animals at times, checking our muscles, examining our faces. Well, youre not entirely hopeless. Seem fit. And once the stylists get hold of you, youll be attractive enough. Peeta and I dont question this. The Hunger Games arent a beauty contest, but the best-looking tributes always seem to pull more sponsors. All right, Ill make a deal with you. You dont interfere with my drinking, and Ill stay sober enough to help you, says Haymitch. But you have to do exactly what I say. Its not much of a deal but still a giant step forward from ten minutes ago when we had no guide at all. Fine, says Peeta. So help us, I say. When we get to the arena, whats the best strategy at the Cornucopia for someone One thing at a time. In a few minutes, well be pulling into the station. Youll be put in the

hands of your stylists. Youre not going to like what they do to you. But no matter what it is, dont resist, says Haymitch. But I begin. No buts. Dont resist, says Haymitch. He takes the bottle of spirits from the table and leaves the car. As the door swings shut behind him, the car goes dark. There are still a few lights inside, but outside its as if night has fallen again. I realize we must be in the tunnel that runs up through the mountains into the Capitol. The mountains form a natural barrier between the Capitol and the eastern districts. It is almost impossible to enter from the east except through the tunnels. This geographical advantage was a major factor in the districts losing the war that led to my being a tribute today. Since the rebels had to scale the mountains, they were easy targets for the Capitols air forces. Peeta Mellark and I stand in silence as the train speeds along. The tunnel goes on and on and I think of the tons of rock separating me from the sky, and my chest tightens. I hate being encased in stone this way. It reminds me of the mines and my father, trapped, unable to reach sunlight, buried forever in the darkness. The train finally begins to slow and suddenly bright light floods the compartment. We cant help it. Both Peeta and I run to the window to see what weve only seen on television, the Capitol, the ruling city of Panem. The cameras havent lied about its grandeur. If anything, they have not quite captured the magnificence of the glistening buildings in

a rainbow of hues that tower into the air, the shiny cars that roll down the wide paved streets, the oddly dressed people with bizarre hair and painted faces who have never missed a meal. All the colors seem artificial, the pinks too deep, the greens too bright, the yellows painful to the eyes, like the flat round disks of hard candy we can never afford to buy at the tiny sweet shop in District 12. The people begin to point at us eagerly as they recognize a tribute train rolling into the city. I step away from the window, sickened by their excitement, knowing they cant wait to watch us die. But Peeta holds his ground, actually waving and smiling at the gawking crowd. He only stops when the train pulls into the station, blocking us from their view. He sees me staring at him and shrugs. Who knows? he says. One of them may be rich. I have misjudged him. I think of his actions since the reaping began. The friendly squeeze of my hand. His father showing up with the cookies and promising to feed Prim . . . Did Peeta put him up to that? His tears at the station. Volunteering to wash Haymitch but then challenging him this morning when apparently the nice-guy approach had failed. And now the waving at the window, already trying to win the crowd. All of the pieces are still fitting together, but I sense he has a plan forming. He hasnt accepted

his death. He is already fighting hard to stay alive. Which also means that kind Peeta Mellark, the boy who gave me the bread, is

fighting hard to kill me.

R-i-i-i-p! I grit my teeth as Venia, a woman with aqua hair and gold tattoos above her eyebrows, yanks a strip of Fabric from my leg tearing out the hair beneath it. Sorry! she pipes in her silly Capitol accent. Youre just so hairy! Why do these people speak in such a high pitch? Why do their jaws barely open when they talk? Why do the ends of their sentences go up as if theyre asking a question? Odd vowels, clipped words, and always a hiss on the letter s . . . No wonder its impossible not to mimic them. Venia makes whats supposed to be a sympathetic face. Good news, though. This is the last one. Ready? I get a grip on the edges of the table Im seated on and nod. The final swathe of my leg hair is uprooted in a painful jerk. Ive been in the Remake Center for more than three hours and I still havent met my stylist. Apparently he has no interest in seeing me until Venia and the other members of my prep team have addressed some obvious problems. This has included scrubbing down my body with a gritty loam that has removed not only dirt but at least three layers of skin, turning my nails into uniform shapes, and primarily, ridding my body of hair. My legs, arms, torso, underarms, and parts of my eyebrows have been stripped of the Muff, leaving me like a plucked bird, ready for roasting. I dont like it. My skin feels sore and tingling

and intensely vulnerable. But I have kept my side of the bargain with Haymitch, and no objection has crossed my lips. Youre doing very well, says some guy named Flavius. He gives his orange corkscrew locks a shake and applies a fresh coat of purple lipstick to his mouth. If theres one thing we cant stand, its a whiner. Grease her down! Venia and Octavia, a plump woman whose entire body has been dyed a pale shade of pea green, rub me down with a lotion that first stings but then soothes my raw skin. Then they pull me from the table, removing the thin robe Ive been allowed to wear off and on. I stand there, completely naked, as the three circle me, wielding tweezers to remove any last bits of hair. I know I should be embarrassed, but theyre so unlike people that Im no more self-conscious than if a trio of oddly colored birds were pecking around my feet. The three step back and admire their work. Excellent! You almost look like a human being now! says Flavius, and they all laugh. I force my lips up into a smile to show how grateful I am. Thank you, I say sweetly. We dont have much cause to look nice in District Twelve. This wins them over completely. Of course, you dont, you poor darling! says Octavia clasping her hands together in distress for me. But dont worry, says Venia. By the time Cinna is through with you, youre going to be absolutely gorgeous! We promise! You know, now that weve gotten rid of all the hair and filth, youre not horrible at all! says Flavius encouragingly. Lets call Cinna! They dart out of the room. Its hard to hate my prep team. Theyre such total idiots. And yet, in an odd way, I know

theyre sincerely trying to help me. I look at the cold white walls and floor and resist the impulse to retrieve my robe. But this Cinna, my stylist, will surely make me remove it at once. Instead my hands go to my hairdo, the one area of my body my prep team had been told to leave alone. My fingers stroke the silky braids my mother so carefully arranged. My mother. I left her blue dress and shoes on the floor of my train car, never thinking about retrieving them, of trying to hold on to a piece of her, of home. Now I wish I had. The door opens and a young man who must be Cinna enters. Im taken aback by how normal he looks. Most of the stylists they interview on television are so dyed, stenciled, and surgically altered theyre grotesque. But Cinnas close-cropped hair appears to be its natural shade of brown. Hes in a simple black shirt and pants. The only concession to self-alteration seems to be metallic gold

eyeliner that has been applied with a light hand. It brings out the flecks of gold in his green eyes. And, despite my disgust with the Capitol and their hideous fashions, I cant help thinking how attractive it looks. Hello, Katniss. Im Cinna, your stylist, he says in a quiet voice somewhat lacking in the Capitols affectations. Hello, I venture cautiously. Just give me a moment, all right? he asks. He walks around my naked body, not touching me, but taking in every inch of it with his eyes. I resist the impulse to cross my arms over my chest. Who did your hair? My mother, I say. Its beautiful. Classic really. And in almost perfect balance with your profile. She has very clever fingers, he says. I had expected someone flamboyant, someone older trying desperately to look young, someone who viewed me as a piece of meat to be prepared for a platter. Cinna has met none of these expectations. Youre new, arent you? I dont think Ive seen you before, I say. Most of the stylists are familiar, constants in the ever-changing pool of tributes. Some have been around my whole life. Yes, this is my first year in the Games, says Cinna. So they gave you District Twelve, I say. Newcomers generally end up with us, the least desirable district. I asked for District Twelve, he says without further explanation. Why dont you put on your robe and well have a chat. Pulling on my robe, I follow him through a door into a sitting room. Two red couches face off over a low table. Three walls are blank, the fourth is entirely glass, providing a window to the city. I can see by the light that it must be around noon, although the sunny sky has turned overcast. Cinna invites me to sit on one of the couches and takes his place across from me. He presses a button on the side of the table. The top splits and from below rises a second tabletop that holds our lunch. Chicken and chunks of oranges cooked in a creamy sauce laid on a bed of pearly white grain, tiny green peas and onions, rolls shaped like flowers, and for dessert, a pudding the color of honey. I try to imagine

assembling this meal myself back home. Chickens are too expensive, but I could make do with a wild turkey. Id need to shoot a second turkey to trade for an orange. Goats milk would have to substitute for cream. We can grow peas in the garden. Id have to get wild onions from the woods. I dont recognize the grain, our own tessera ration cooks down to an unattractive brown mush. Fancy rolls would mean another trade with the baker, perhaps for two or three squirrels. As for the

pudding, I cant even guess whats in it. Days of hunting and gathering for this one meal and even then it would be a poor substitution for the Capitol version. What must it be like, I wonder, to live in a world where food appears at the press of a button? How would I spend the hours I now commit to combing the woods for sustenance if it were so easy to come by? What do they do all day, these people in the Capitol, besides decorating their bodies and waiting around for a new shipment of tributes to roll in and die for their entertainment? I look up and find Cinnas eyes trained on mine. How despicable we must seem to you, he says. Has he seen this in my face or somehow read my thoughts? Hes right, though. The whole rotten lot of them is despicable. No matter, says Cinna. So, Katniss, about your costume for the opening ceremonies. My partner, Portia, is the stylist for your fellow tribute, Peeta. And our current thought is to dress you in complementary costumes, says Cinna. As you know, its customary to reflect the flavor of the district. For the opening ceremonies, youre supposed to wear something that suggests your districts principal industry. District 11, agriculture. District 4, fishing. District 3, factories. This means that coming from District 12, Peeta and I will be in some kind of coal miners getup.Since the baggy miners jumpsuits are not particularly becoming, our tributes usually end up in skimpy outfits and hats with headlamps. One year, our tributes were stark naked and covered in black powder to represent coal dust. Its always dreadful and does nothing to win favor with the crowd. I prepare myself for the worst. So, Ill be in a coal miner outfit? I ask, hoping it wont be indecent. Not exactly. You see, Portia and I think that coal miner things very overdone. No one will remember you in that. And we both see it as our job to make the District Twelve tributes unforgettable, says Cinna. Ill be naked for sure, I think. So rather than focus on the coal mining itself, were going to focus on the coal, says Cinna. Naked and covered in black dust, I think. And what do we do with coal? We burn it, says Cinna. Youre not afraid of fire, are you, Katniss? He sees my expression and grins. A few hours later, I am dressed in what will either be the most sensational or the deadliest costume in the opening ceremonies. Im in a simple black unitard that covers me from ankle to neck. Shiny leather boots lace up to my knees. But its the fluttering cape made of streams of orange, yellow,


and red and the matching headpiece that define this costume. Cinna plans to light them on fire just before our chariot rolls into the streets. Its not real flame, of course, just a little synthetic fire Portia and I came up with. Youll be perfectly safe, he says. But Im not convinced I wont be perfectly barbecued by the time we reach the citys center. My face is relatively clear of makeup, just a bit of highlighting here and there. My hair has been brushed out and then braided down my back in my usual style. I want the audience to recognize you when youre in the arena, says Cinna dreamily. Katniss, the girl who was on fire. It crosses my mind that Cinnas calm and normal demeanor masks a complete madman. Despite this mornings revelation about Peetas character, Im actually relieved when he shows up, dressed in an identical costume. He should know about fire, being a bakers son and all. His stylist, Portia, and her team accompany him in, and everyone is absolutely giddy with excitement over what a splash well make. Except Cinna. He just seems a bit weary as he accepts congratulations. Were whisked down to the bottom level of the Remake Center, which is essentially a gigantic stable. The opening ceremonies are about to start. Pairs of tributes are being loaded into chariots pulled by teams of four horses.Ours are coal black. The animals are so well trained, no one even needs to guide their reins. Cinna and Portia direct us into the chariot and carefully arrange our body positions, the drape of our capes, before moving off to consult with each other. What do you think? I whisper to Peeta. About the fire? Ill rip off your cape if youll rip off mine, he says through gritted teeth. Deal, I say. Maybe, if we can get them off soon enough, well avoid the worst burns. Its bad though. Theyll throw us into the arena no matter what condition were in. I know we promised Haymitch wed do exactly what they said, but I dont think he considered this angle. Where is Haymitch, anyway? Isnt he supposed to protect us from this sort of thing? says Peeta. With all that alcohol in him, its probably not advisable to have him around an open flame, I say. And suddenly were both laughing. I guess were both so nervous about the Games and more pressingly, petrified of being turned into human torches, were not acting sensibly. The opening music begins. Its easy to hear, blasted around the Capitol. Massive doors slide open revealing the crowd-lined streets. The ride lasts about twenty minutes and ends up at the City Circle, where they will welcome us, play the anthem, and escort us into the Training Center, which will be our home/prison until

the Games begin. The tributes from District 1 ride out in a chariot pulled by snow-white horses. They look so beautiful, spray-painted silver, in tasteful tunics glittering with jewels. District 1 makes luxury items for the Capitol. You can hear the roar of the crowd. They are always favorites. District 2 gets into position to follow them. In

no time at all, we are approaching the door and I can see that between the overcast sky and evening hour the light is turning gray. The tributes from District 11 are just rolling out when Cinna appears with a lighted torch. Here we go then, he says, and before we can react he sets our capes on fire. I gasp, waiting for the heat, but there is only a faint tickling sensation. Cinna climbs up before us and ignites our headdresses. He lets out a sign of relief. It works. Then he gently tucks a hand under my chin. Remember, heads high. Smiles. Theyre going to love you! Cinna jumps off the chariot and has one last idea. He shouts something up at us, but the music drowns him out. He shouts again and gestures. Whats he saying? I ask Peeta. For the first time, I look at him and realize that ablaze with the fake flames, he is dazzling. And I must be, too. I think he said for us to hold hands, says Peeta. He grabs my right hand in his left, and we look to Cinna for confirmation. He nods and gives a thumbs-up, and thats the last thing I see before we enter the city. The crowds initial alarm at our appearance quickly changes to cheers and shouts of District Twelve! Every head is turned our way, pulling the focus from the three chariots ahead of us. At first, Im frozen, but then I catch sight of us on a large television screen and am floored by how breathtaking we look. In the deepening twilight, the firelight illuminates our faces. We seem to be leaving a trail of fire off the flowing capes. Cinna was right about the minimal makeup, we both look more attractive but utterly recognizable. Remember, heads high. Smiles. Theyre going to love you! I hear Cinnas voice in my head. I lift my chin a bit higher, put on my most winning smile, and wave with my free hand. Im glad now I have Peeta to clutch for balance, he is so steady, solid as a rock. As I gain confidence, I actually blow a few kisses to the crowd. The people of the Capitol are going nuts, showering us with flowers, shouting our names, our first names, which they have bothered to find on the program. The pounding music, the cheers, the admiration work their way into my blood, and I cant suppress my excitement. Cinna has given me a great advantage. No one will forget me. Not my look, not my name.

Katniss. The girl who was on fire. For the first time, I feel a flicker of hope rising up in me. Surely, there must be one sponsor willing to take me on! And with a little extra help, some food, the right weapon, why should I count myself out of the Games? Someone throws me a red rose. I catch it, give it a delicate sniff, and blow a kiss back in the general direction of the giver. A hundred hands reach up to catch my kiss, as if it were a real and tangible thing. Katniss! Katniss! I can hear my name being called from all sides. Everyone wants my kisses. Its not until we enter the City Circle that I realize I must have completely stopped the circulation in Peetas hand. Thats how tightly Ive been holding it. I look

down at our linked fingers as I loosen my grasp, but he regains his grip on me. No, dont let go of me, he says. The firelight flickers off his blue eyes. Please. I might fall out of this thing. Okay, I say. So I keep holding on, but I cant help feeling strange about the way Cinna has linked us together. Its not really fair to present us as a team and then lock us into the arena to kill each other. The twelve chariots fill the loop of the City Circle. On the buildings that surround the Circle, every window is packed with the most prestigious citizens of the Capitol. Our horses pull our chariot right up to President Snows mansion, and we come to a halt. The music ends with a flourish. The president, a small, thin man with paper-white hair, gives the official welcome from a balcony above us. It is traditional to cut away to the faces of the tributes during the speech. But I can see on the screen that we are getting way more than our share of airtime. The darker it becomes, the more difficult it is to take your eyes off our flickering. When the national anthem plays, they do make an effort to do a quick cut around to each pair of tributes, but the camera holds on the District 12 chariot as it parades around the circle one final time and disappears into the Training Center. The doors have only just shut behind us when were engulfed by the prep teams, who are nearly unintelligible as they babble out praise. As I glance around, I notice a lot of the other tributes are shooting us dirty looks, which confirms what Ive suspected, weve literally outshone them all. Then Cinna and Portia are there, helping us down from the chariot, carefully removing our flaming capes and headdresses. Portia extinguishes them with some kind of spray from a canister. I realize Im still glued to Peeta and force my stiff fingers to open. We both massage our hands. Thanks

for keeping hold of me. I was getting a little shaky there, says Peeta. It didnt show, I tell him. Im sure no one noticed. Im sure they didnt notice anything but you. You should wear flames more often, he says. They suit you. And then he gives me a smile that seems so genuinely sweet with just the right touch of shyness that unexpected warmth rushes through me. A warning bell goes off in my head. Dont be so stupid. Peeta is planning how to kill you, I remind myself. He is luring you in to make you easy prey. The more likable he is, the more deadly he is. But because two can play at this game, I stand on tiptoe and kiss his cheek. Right on his bruise.

6.

The Training Center has a tower designed exclusively for the tributes and their teams. This will be our home until the actual Games begin. Each district has an entire floor. You simply step onto an elevator and press the number of your district. Easy enough to remember. Ive ridden the elevator a couple of times in the Justice Building back in District 12. Once to receive the medal for my fathers death and then yesterday to say my final goodbyes to my friends and

family. But thats a dark and creaky thing that moves like a snail and smells of sour milk. The walls of this elevator are made of crystal so that you can watch the people on the ground floor shrink to ants as you shoot up into the air. Its exhilarating and Im tempted to ask Effie Trinket if we can ride it again, but somehow that seems childish. Apparently, Effie Trinkets duties did not conclude at the station. She and Haymitch will be overseeing us right into the arena. In a way, thats a plus because at least she can be counted on to corral us around to places on time whereas we havent seen Haymitch since he agreed to help us on the train. Probably passed out somewhere. Effie Trinket, on the other hand, seems to be flying high. Were the first team shes ever chaperoned that made a splash at the opening ceremonies. Shes complimentary about not just our costumes but how we conducted ourselves. And, to hear her tell it, Effie knows everyone whos anyone in the Capitol and has been talking us up all day, trying to win us sponsors. Ive been very mysterious, though, she says, her eyes squint half shut. Because, of course, Haymitch hasnt bothered to

tell me your strategies. But Ive done my best with what I had to work with. How Katniss sacrificed herself for her sister. How youve both successfully struggled to overcome the barbarism of your district. Barbarism? Thats ironic coming from a woman helping to prepare us for slaughter. And whats she basing our success on? Our table manners? Everyone has their reservations, naturally. You being from the coal district. But I said, and this was very clever of me, I said, Well, if you put enough pressure on coal it turns to pearls! Effie beams at us so brilliantly that we have no choice but to respond enthusiastically to her cleverness even though its wrong. Coal doesnt turn to pearls. They grow in shellfish. Possibly she meant coal turns to diamonds, but thats untrue, too. Ive heard they have some sort of machine in District 1 that can turn graphite into diamonds. But we dont mine graphite in District 12. That was part of District 13s job until they were destroyed. I wonder if the people shes been plugging us to all day either know or care. Unfortunately, I cant seal the sponsor deals for you. Only Haymitch can do that, says Effie grimly. But dont worry, Ill get him to the table at gunpoint if necessary. Although lacking in many departments, Effie Trinket has a certain determination I have to admire. My quarters are larger than our entire house back home. They are plush, like the train car, but also have so many automatic gadgets that Im sure I wont have time to press all the buttons. The shower alone has a panel with more than a hundred options you can choose regulating water temperature, pressure, soaps, shampoos, scents, oils, and massaging sponges. When you step out on a mat, heaters come on that blow-dry your body. Instead of struggling with the knots in my wet hair, I merely place my hand on a box that sends

a current through my scalp, untangling, parting, and drying my hair almost instantly. It floats down around my shoulders in a glossy curtain. I program the closet for an outfit to my taste. The windows zoom in and out on parts of the city at my command. You need only whisper a type of food from a gigantic menu into a mouthpiece and it appears, hot and steamy, before you in less than a minute. I walk around the room eating goose liver and puffy bread until theres a knock on the door. Effies calling me to dinner. Good. Im starving. Peeta, Cinna, and Portia are standing out on a balcony that overlooks the Capitol when we enter the dining room. Im glad

to see the stylists, particularly after I hear that Haymitch will be joining us. A meal presided over by just Effie and Haymitch is bound to be a disaster. Besides, dinner isnt really about food, its about planning out our strategies, and Cinna and Portia have already proven how valuable they are. A silent young man dressed in a white tunic offers us all stemmed glasses of wine. I think about turning it down, but Ive never had wine, except the homemade stuff my mother uses for coughs, and when will I get a chance to try it again? I take a sip of the tart, dry liquid and secretly think it could be improved by a few spoonfuls of honey. Haymitch shows up just as dinner is being served. It looks as if hes had his own stylist because hes clean and groomed and about as sober as Ive ever seen him. He doesnt refuse the offer of wine, but when he starts in on his soup, I realize its the first time Ive ever seen him eat. Maybe he really will pull himself together long enough to help us. Cinna and Portia seem to have a civilizing effect on Haymitch and Effie. At least theyre addressing each other decently. And they both have nothing but praise for our stylists opening act. While they make small talk, I concentrate on the meal. Mushroom soup, bitter greens with tomatoes the size of peas, rare roast beef sliced as thin as paper, noodles in a green sauce, cheese that melts on your tongue served with sweet blue grapes. The servers, all young people dressed in white tunics like the one who gave us wine, move wordlessly to and from the table, keeping the platters and glasses full. About halfway through my glass of wine, my head starts feeling foggy, so I change to water instead. I dont like the feeling and hope it wears off soon. How Haymitch can stand walking around like this full-time is a mystery. I try to focus on the talk, which has turned to our interview costumes, when a girl sets a gorgeous-looking cake on the table and deftly lights it. It blazes up and then the flames flicker around the edges awhile until it finally goes out. I have a moment of doubt. What makes it burn? Is it alcohol? I say, looking up at the girl. Thats the last thing I wa oh! I know you! I cant place a name or time to the girls face. But Im certain of it. The dark red hair, the striking features, the porcelain white skin. But even as I utter the words, I feel my insides contracting with anxiety and guilt at the sight of her, and while I cant pull it up, I know some bad memory is associated with her. The expression of terror that crosses her face only adds to my confusion and unease. She shakes her head in denial quickly and hurries away from the table. When I look back, the four adults are watching me like hawks. Dont be ridiculous, Katniss. How could you possibly know an Avox? snaps Effie. The very thought. Whats an Avox? I ask stupidly. Someone who committed a crime. They cut her tongue so she cant speak, says Haymitch. Shes probably a traitor of some sort. Not likely youd know her. And even if you did, youre not to speak to one of them unless its to give an order, says Effie. Of course, you dont really know her. But I do know her. And now that Haymitch has mentioned the word traitor I remember from where. The

disapproval is so high I could never admit it. No, I guess not, I just I stammer, and the wine is not helping. Peeta snaps his fingers. Delly Cartwright. Thats who it is. I kept thinking she looked familiar as well. Then I realized shes a dead ringer for Delly. Delly Cartwright is a pasty-faced, lumpy girl with yellowish hair who looks about as much like our server as a beetle does a butterfly. She may also be the friendliest person on the planet she smiles constantly at everybody in school, even me. I have never seen the girl with the red hair smile. But I jump on Peetas suggestion gratefully. Of course, thats who I was thinking of. It must be the hair, I say. Something about the eyes, too, says Peeta. The energy at the table relaxes. Oh, well. If thats all it is, says Cinna. And yes, the cake has spirits, but all the alcohol has burned off. I ordered it specially in honor of your fiery debut. We eat the cake and move into a sitting room to watch the replay of the opening ceremonies thats being broadcast. A few of the other couples make a nice impression, but none of them can hold a candle to us. Even our own party lets out an Ahh! as they show us coming out of the Remake Center. Whose idea was the hand holding? asks Haymitch. Cinnas, says Portia. Just the perfect touch of rebellion, says Haymitch. Very nice. Rebellion? I have to think about that one a moment. But when I remember the other couples, standing stiffly apart, never touching or acknowledging each other, as if their fellow tribute did not exist, as if the Games had already begun, I know what Haymitch means. Presenting ourselves not as adversaries but as friends has distinguished us as much as the fiery costumes. Tomorrow morning is the first training session. Meet me for breakfast and Ill tell you exactly how I want you to play it, says Haymitch to Peeta and I. Now go get some sleep while the grown-ups talk. Peeta and I walk together down the corridor to our rooms. When we get to my door, he leans against the frame, not blocking my entrance exactly but insisting I pay attention to him. So, Delly Cartwright.

Imagine finding her lookalike here. Hes asking for an explanation, and Im tempted to give him one. We both know he covered for me. So here I am in his debt again. If I tell him the truth about the girl, somehow that might even things up. How can it hurt really? Even if he repeated the story, it couldnt do me much harm. It was just something I witnessed. And he lied as much as I did about Delly Cartwright. I realize I do want to talk to someone about the girl. Someone who might be able to

help me figure out her story. Gale would be my first choice, but its unlikely Ill ever see Gale again. I try to think if telling Peeta could give him any possible advantage over me, but I dont see how. Maybe sharing a confidence will actually make him believe I see him as a friend. Besides, the idea of the girl with her maimed tongue frightens me. She has reminded me why Im here. Not to model flashy costumes and eat delicacies. But to die a bloody death while the crowds urge on my killer. To tell or not to tell? My brain still feels slow from the wine. I stare down the empty corridor as if the decision lies there. Peeta picks up on my hesitation. Have you been on the roof yet? I shake my head. Cinna showed me. You can practically see the whole city. The winds a bit loud, though. I translate this into No one will overhear us talking in my head. You do have the sense that we might be under surveillance here. Can we just go up? Sure, come on, says Peeta. I follow him to a flight of stairs that lead to the roof. Theres a small dome-shaped room with a door to the outside. As we step into the cool, windy evening air, I catch my breath at the view. The Capitol twinkles like a vast field of fireflies. Electricity in District 12 comes and goes, usually we only have it a few hours a day. Often the evenings are spent in candlelight. The only time you can count on it is when theyre airing the Games or some important government message on television that its mandatory to watch. But here there would be no shortage. Ever. Peeta and I walk to a railing at the edge of the roof. I look straight down the side of the building to the street, which is buzzing with people. You can hear their cars, an occasional shout, and a strange metallic tinkling. In District 12, wed all be thinking about bed right now. I asked Cinna why they let us up here. Werent they worried that some of the tributes might decide to jump right over the side? says Peeta. Whatd he say? I ask. You cant, says Peeta. He holds out his hand into seemingly empty space. Theres a sharp zap and he jerks it back. Some kind of electric field throws you back on the roof. Always worried about our safety, I say. Even though Cinna has shown Peeta the roof, I wonder if were supposed to be up here now, so late and alone. Ive never seen tributes on the Training Center roof before. But that doesnt mean were not being taped. Do you think theyre watching us now? Maybe, he admits. Come see the garden. On the other side of the dome,

theyve built a garden with flower beds and potted trees. From the branches

hang hundreds of wind chimes, which account for the tinkling I heard. Here in the garden, on this windy night, its enough to drown out two people who are trying not to be heard. Peeta looks at me expectantly. I pretend to examine a blossom. We were hunting in the woods one day. Hidden, waiting for game, I whisper. You and your father? he whispers back. No, my friend Gale. Suddenly all the birds stopped singing at once. Except one. As if it were giving a warning call. And then we saw her. Im sure it was the same girl. A boy was with her. Their clothes were tattered. They had dark circles under their eyes from no sleep. They were running as if their lives depended on it, I say. For a moment Im silent, as I remember how the sight of this strange pair, clearly not from District 12, fleeing through the woods immobilized us. Later, we wondered if we could have helped them escape. Perhaps we might have. Concealed them. If wed moved quickly. Gale and I were taken by surprise, yes, but were both hunters. We know how animals look at bay. We knew the pair was in trouble as soon as we saw them. But we only watched. The hovercraft appeared out of nowhere, I continue to Peeta. I mean, one moment the sky was empty and the next it was there. It didnt make a sound, but they saw it. A net dropped down on the girl and carried her up, fast, so fast like the elevator. They shot some sort of spear through the boy. It was attached to a cable and they hauled him up as well. But Im certain he was dead. We heard the girl scream once. The boys name, I think. Then it was gone, the hovercraft. Vanished into thin air. And the birds began to sing again, as if nothing had happened. Did they see you? Peeta asked. I dont know. We were under a shelf of rock, I reply. But I do know. There was a moment, after the birdcall, but before the hovercraft, where the girl had seen us. Shed locked eyes with me and called out for help. But neither Gale or I had responded. Youre shivering, says Peeta. The wind and the story have blown all the warmth from my body. The girls scream. Had it been her last? Peeta takes off his jacket and wraps it around my shoulders. I start to take a step back, but then I let him, deciding for a moment to accept both his jacket and his kindness. A friend would do that, right? They were from here? he asks, and he secures a button at my neck. I nod. Theyd had that Capitol look about them. The boy and the girl. Where do you suppose they were going? he asks. I dont know that, I say. District 12 is pretty much the end of the line. Beyond us, theres only wilderness. If you dont count the ruins of District 13 that still smolder from the toxic

bombs. They show it on television occasionally, just to remind us. Or why they would leave here. Haymitch had called the Avoxes traitors. Against what? It could only be the Capitol. But they had everything here. No cause to rebel. Id leave here, Peeta blurts

out. Then he looks around nervously. It was loud enough to hear above the chimes. He laughs. Id go home now if they let me. But you have to admit, the foods prime. Hes covered again. If thats all youd heard it would just sound like the words of a scared tribute, not someone contemplating the unquestionable goodness of the Capitol. Its getting chilly. We better go in, he says. Inside the dome, its warm and bright. His tone is conversational. Your friend Gale. Hes the one who took your sister away at the reaping? Yes. Do you know him? I ask. Not really. I hear the girls talk about him a lot. I thought he was your cousin or something. You favor each other, he says. No, were not related, I say. Peeta nods, unreadable. Did he come to say good-bye to you? Yes, I say, observing him carefully. So did your father. He brought me cookies. Peeta raises his eyebrows as if this is news. But after watching him lie so smoothly, I dont give this much weight. Really? Well, he likes you and your sister. I think he wishes he had a daughter instead of a houseful of boys. The idea that I might ever have been discussed, around the dinner table, at the bakery fire, just in passing in Peetas house gives me a start. It must have been when the mother was out of the room. He knew your mother when they were kids, says Peeta. Another surprise. But probably true. Oh, yes. She grew up in town, I say. It seems impolite to say she never mentioned the baker except to compliment his bread. Were at my door. I give back his jacket. See you in the morning then. See you, he says, and walks off down the hall. When I open my door, the redheaded girl is collecting my unitard and boots from where I left them on the floor before my shower. I want to apologize for possibly getting her in trouble earlier. But I remember Im not supposed to speak to her unless Im giving her an order. Oh, sorry, I say. I was supposed to get those back to Cinna. Im sorry. Can you take them to him? She avoids my eyes, gives a small nod, and heads out the door. Id set out to tell her I was sorry about dinner. But I know that my apology runs much deeper. That Im ashamed I never tried to help her in the woods. That I let the Capitol kill the boy and mutilate her without lifting a

finger. Just like I was watching the Games. I kick off my shoes and climb under the covers in my clothes. The shivering hasnt stopped. Perhaps the girl doesnt even remember me. But I know she does. You dont forget the face of the person who was your last hope. I pull the covers up over my head as if this will protect me from the redheaded girl who cant speak. But I can feel her eyes staring at me, piercing through walls and doors and bedding. I wonder if shell enjoy watching me die.

7.

My slumbers are filled with disturbing dreams. The face of the redheaded girl intertwines with gory images from earlier Hunger Games, with my mother withdrawn and unreachable, with Prim emaciated and terrified. I bolt up screaming for my father to run as the mine

explodes into a million deadly bits of light. Dawn is breaking through the windows. The Capitol has a misty, haunted air. My head aches and I must have bitten into the side of my cheek in the night. My tongue probes the ragged flesh and I taste blood. Slowly, I drag myself out of bed and into the shower. I arbitrarily punch buttons on the control board and end up hopping from foot to foot as alternating jets of icy cold and steaming hot water assault me. Then Im deluged in lemony foam that I have to scrape off with a heavy bristled brush. Oh, well. At least my blood is flowing. When Im dried and moisturized with lotion, I find an outfit has been left for me at the front of the closet. Tight black pants, a long-sleeved burgundy tunic, and leather shoes. I put my hair in the single braid down my back. This is the first time since the morning of the reaping that I resemble myself. No fancy hair and clothes, no flaming capes. Just me. Looking like I could be headed for the woods. It calms me. Haymitch didnt give us an exact time to meet for break-last and no one has contacted me this morning, but Im hungry so I head down to the dining room, hoping there will be food. Im not disappointed. While the table is empty, a long board off to the side has been laid with at least twenty dishes. A young man, an Avox, stands at attention by the spread. When I ask if I can serve myself, he nods assent. I load a plate with eggs, sausages, batter cakes covered in thick orange preserves, slices of pale purple melon.

As I gorge myself, I watch the sun rise over the Capitol. I have a second plate of hot grain smothered in beef stew. Finally, I fill a plate with rolls and sit at the table, breaking oil bits and dipping them into hot chocolate, the way Peeta did on the train. My mind wanders to my mother and Prim. They must be up. My mother getting their breakfast of mush. Prim milking her goat before school. Just two mornings ago, I was home. Can that be right? Yes, just two. And now how empty the house feels, even from a distance. What did they say last night about my fiery debut at the Games? Did it give them hope, or simply add to their terror when they saw the reality of twenty-four tributes circled together, knowing only one could live? Haymitch and Peeta come in, bid me good morning, fill their plates. It makes me irritated that Peeta is wearing exactly the same outfit I am. I need to say something to Cinna. This twins act is going to blow up in out faces once the Games begin. Surely, they must know this. Then I remember Haymitch telling me to do exactly what the stylists tell me to do. If it was anyone but Cinna, I might be tempted to ignore him. But after last nights triumph, I dont have a lot of room to criticize his choices. Im nervous about the training. There will be three days in which all the tributes practice together. On the last afternoon, well each get a chance to perform in private before the Gamemakers. The thought of meeting the other tributes

face-to-face makes me queasy. I turn the roll I have just taken from the basket over and over in my hands, but my appetite is gone. When Haymitch has finished several platters of stew, he pushes back his plate with a sigh. He takes a flask from his pocket and takes a long pull on it and leans his elbows on the table. So, lets get down to business. Training. First off, if you like, Ill coach you separately. Decide now. Why would you coach us separately? I ask. Say if you had a secret skill you might not want the other to know about, says Haymitch. I exchange a look with Peeta. I dont have any secret skills, he says. And I already know what yours is, right? I mean, Ive eaten enough of your squirrels. I never thought about Peeta eating the squirrels I shot. Somehow I always pictured the baker quietly going off and frying them up for himself. Not out of greed. But because town families usually eat expensive butcher meat. Beef and chicken and horse. You can coach us together, I tell Haymitch. Peeta nods. All right, so give me some idea of what you can do, says Haymitch. I cant do

anything, says Peeta. Unless you count baking bread. Sorry, I dont. Katniss. I already know youre handy with a knife, says Haymitch. Not really. But I can hunt, I say. With a bow and arrow. And youre good? asks Haymitch. I have to think about it. Ive been putting food on the table for four years. Thats no small task. Im not as good as my father was, but hed had more practice. Ive better aim than Gale, but Ive had more practice. Hes a genius with traps and snares. Im all right, I say. Shes excellent, says Peeta. My father buys her squirrels. He always comments on how the arrows never pierce the body. She hits every one in the eye. Its the same with the rabbits she sells the butcher. She can even bring down deer. This assessment of my skills from Peeta takes me totally by surprise. First, that he ever noticed. Second, that hes talking me up. What are you doing? I ask him suspiciously. What are you doing? If hes going to help you, he has to know what youre capable of. Dont underrate yourself, says Peeta. I dont know why, but this rubs me the wrong way. What about you? Ive seen you in the market. You can lift hundred-pound bags of flour, I snap at him. Tell him that. Thats not nothing. Yes, and Im sure the arena will be full of bags of flour for me to chuck at people. Its not like being able to use a weapon. You know it isnt, he shoots back. He can wrestle, I tell Haymitch. He came in second in our school competition last year, only after his brother. What use is that? How many times have you seen someone wrestle someone to death? says Peeta in disgust. Theres always hand-to-hand combat. All you need is to come up with a knife, and youll at least stand a chance. If I get jumped, Im dead! I can hear my voice rising in anger. But you wont! Youll be living up in some tree eating raw squirrels and picking off people with arrows. You know what my mother said to me when she came to say

good-bye, as if to cheer me up, she says maybe District Twelve will finally have a winner. Then I realized, she didnt mean me, she meant you! bursts out Peeta. Oh, she meant you, I say with a wave of dismissal. She said, Shes a survivor, that one. She is, says Peeta. That pulls me up short. Did his mother really say that about me? Did she rate me over her son? I see the pain in Peetas eyes and know he isnt lying. Suddenly Im behind the bakery and I can feel the chill of the rain running down my back, the hollowness in my belly. I sound eleven years old when I speak. But only because someone helped me. Peetas eyes flicker down to the roll in my hands, and I

know he remembers that day, too. But he just shrugs. People will help you in the arena. Theyll be tripping over each other to sponsor you. No more than you, I say. Peeta rolls his eyes at Haymitch. She has no idea. The effect she can have. He runs his fingernail along the wood grain in the table, refusing to look at me. What on earth does he mean? People help me? When we were dying of starvation, no one helped me! No one except Peeta. Once I had something to barter with, things changed. Im a tough trader. Or am I? What effect do I have? That Im weak and needy? Is he suggesting that I got good deals because people pitied me? I try to think if this is true. Perhaps some of the merchants were a little generous in their trades, but I always attributed that to their long-standing relationship with my father. Besides, my game is first-class. No one pitied me! I glower at the roll sure he meant to insult me. After about a minute of this, Haymitch says, Well, then. Well, well, well. Katniss, theres no guarantee theyll be bows and arrows in the arena, but during your private session with the Gamemakers, show them what you can do. Until then, stay clear of archery. Are you any good at trapping? I know a few basic snares, I mutter. That may be significant in terms of food, says Haymitch. And Peeta, shes right, never  underestimate strength in the arena. Very often, physical power tilts the advantage to a player. In the Training Center, they will have weights, but dont reveal how much you can lift in front of the other tributes. The plans the same for both of you. You go to group training. Spend the time trying to learn something you dont know. Throw a spear. Swing a mace. Learn to tie a decent knot. Save showing what youre best at until your private sessions. Are we clear? says Haymitch. Peeta and I nod. One last thing. In public, I want you by each others side every minute, says Haymitch. We both start to object, but Haymitch slams his hand on the table. Every minute! Its not open for discussion! You agreed to do as I said! You will be together, you will appear amiable to each other. Now get out. Meet Effie at the elevator at ten for training. I bite my lip and stalk back to my room, making sure Peeta can hear the door slam. I sit on the bed, hating Haymitch, hating Peeta, hating myself for mentioning

that day long ago in the rain. Its such a joke! Peeta and I going along pretending to be friends! Talking up each others strengths, insisting the other take credit for their abilities. Because, in fact, at some point, were going to have to knock it off and accept

were bitter adversaries. Which Id be prepared to do right now if it wasnt for Haymitchs stupid instruction that we stick together in training. Its my own fault, I guess, for telling him he didnt have to coach us separately. But that didnt mean I wanted to do everything with Peeta. Who, by the way, clearly doesnt want to be partnering up with me, either. I hear Peetas voice in my head. She has no idea. The effect she can have. Obviously meant to demean me. Right? but a tiny part of me wonders if this was a compliment. That he meant I was appealing in some way. Its weird, how much hes noticed me. Like the attention hes paid to my hunting. And apparently, I have not been as oblivious to him as I imagined, either. The flour. The wrestling. I have kept track of the boy with the bread. Its almost ten. I clean my teeth and smooth back my hair again. Anger temporarily blocked out my nervousness about meeting the other tributes, but now I can feel my anxiety rising again. By the time I meet Effie and Peeta at the elevator, I catch myself biting my nails. I stop at once. The actual training rooms are below ground level of our building. With these elevators, the ride is less than a minute. The doors open into an enormous gymnasium filled with various weapons and obstacle courses. Although its not yet ten, were the last ones to arrive. The other tributes are gathered in a tense circle. They each have a cloth square with their district number on it pinned to their shirts. While someone pins the number 12 on my back, I do a quick assessment. Peeta and I are the only two dressed alike. As soon as we join the circle, the head trainer, a tall, athletic woman named Atala steps up and begins to explain the training schedule. Experts in each skill will remain at their stations. We will be free to travel from area to area as we choose, per our mentors instructions. Some of the stations teach survival skills, others fighting techniques. We are forbidden to engage in any combative exercise with another tribute. There are assistants on hand if we want to practice with a partner. When Atala begins to read down the list of the skill stations, my eyes cant help flitting around to the other tributes. Its the first time weve been assembled, on level ground, in simple clothes. My heart sinks. Almost all of the boys and at least half of the girls are bigger than I am, even though many of the tributes have never been fed properly. You can see it in their bones, their skin, the hollow look in their eyes. I may be smaller naturally, but overall my familys resourcefulness has given me an edge in that area. I stand straight, and while Im thin, Im strong. The

meat and plants from the woods combined with the exertion it took

to get them have given me a healthier body than most of those I see around me. The exceptions are the kids from the wealthier districts, the volunteers, the ones who have been fed and trained throughout their lives for this moment. The tributes from 1, 2, and 4 traditionally have this look about them. Its technically against the rules to train tributes before they reach the Capitol but it happens every year. In District 12, we call them the Career Tributes, or just the Careers. And like as not, the winner will be one of them. The slight advantage I held coming into the Training Center, my fiery entrance last night, seems to vanish in the presence of my competition. The other tributes were jealous of us, but not because we were amazing, because our stylists were. Now I see nothing but contempt in the glances of the Career Tributes. Each must have fifty to a hundred pounds on me. They project arrogance and brutality. When Atala releases us, they head straight for the deadliest-looking weapons in the gym and handle them with ease. Im thinking that its lucky Im a fast runner when Peeta nudges my arm and I jump. He is still beside me, per Haymitchs instructions.His expression is sober. Where would you like to start? I look around at the Career Tributes who are showing off, clearly trying to intimidate the field. Then at the others, the underfed, the incompetent, shakily having their first lessons with a knife or an ax. Suppose we tie some knots, I say. Right you are, says Peeta. We cross to an empty station where the trainer seems pleased to have students. You get the feeling that the knot-tying class is not the Hunger games hot spot. When he realizes I know something about snares, he shows us a simple, excellent trap that will leave a human competitor dangling by a leg from a tree. We concentrate on this one skill for an hour until both of us have mastered it. Then we move on to camouflage. Peeta genuinely seems to enjoy this station, swirling a combination of mud and clay and berry juices around on his pale skin, weaving disguises from vines and leaves. The trainer who runs the camouflage station is full of enthusiasm at his work. I do the cakes, he admits to me. The cakes? I ask. Ive been preoccupied with watching the boy from District 2 send a spear through a dummys heart from fifteen yards. What cakes? At home. The iced ones, for the bakery, he says. He means the ones they display in the windows. Fancy cakes with flowers and pretty things painted in frosting. Theyre for birthdays

and New Years Day. When were in the square, Prim always drags me over to admire them, although wed never be able to afford one. Theres little enough beauty in District 12, though, so I can hardly deny her this. I look more critically at the design on Peetas arm. The alternating pattern of light and dark suggests sunlight falling through the leaves in the woods. I wonder how he knows this, since I doubt hes ever been beyond the fence. Has he been able to pick this up from just that scraggly old apple tree in his backyard? Somehow the whole thing his skill, those inaccessible cakes, the praise of the camouflage expert annoys me. Its lovely. If only you could frost someone to death, I say. Dont be so superior. You can never tell what youll find in the arena. Say its actually a gigantic cake begins Peeta. Say we move on, I break in. So the next three days pass with Peeta and I going quietly from station to station. We do pick up some valuable skills, from starting fires, to knife throwing, to making shelter. Despite Haymitchs order to appear mediocre, Peeta excels in hand-to-hand combat, and I sweep the edible plants test without blinking an eye. We steer clear of archery and weightlifting though, wanting to save those for our private sessions. The Gamemakers appeared early on the first day. Twenty or so men and women dressed in deep purple robes. They sit in the elevated stands that surround the gymnasium, sometimes wandering about to watch us, jotting down notes, other times eating at the endless banquet that has been set for them, ignoring the lot of us. But they do seem to be keeping their eye on the District 12 tributes. Several times Ive looked up to find one fixated on me. They consult with the trainers during our meals as well. We see them all gathered together when we come back. Breakfast and dinner are served on our floor, but at lunch the twenty-four of us eat in a dining room off the gymnasium. Food is arranged on carts around the room and you serve yourself. The Career Tributes tend to gather rowdily around one table, as if to prove their superiority, that they have no fear of one another and consider the rest of us beneath notice. Most of the other tributes sit alone, like lost sheep. No one says a word to us. Peeta and I eat together, and since Haymitch keeps dogging us about it, try to keep up a friendly conversation during the meals. Its not easy to find a topic. Talking of home is painful. Talking of the present unbearable. One day, Peeta empties our breadbasket and points out how they have been careful to

include types from the districts along with the refined bread of the Capitol. The fish-shaped loaf tinted green with seaweed from District 4. The crescent moon roll dotted with seeds from District 11. Somehow, although its made from the same stuff, it looks a lot more appetizing than the ugly drop biscuits that are the standard fare at home. And there you have it, says Peeta, scooping the breads back in the basket. You certainly know a lot, I say. Only about bread, he says. Okay, now laugh as if Ive said something funny. We both give a somewhat convincing laugh and ignore the stares from around the room. All right, Ill keep smiling pleasantly and you talk, says Peeta. Its wearing us both out, Haymitchs direction to be friendly. Because ever since I slammed my door, theres been a chill in the air between us. But we have our orders. Did I ever tell you about the time I was chased by a bear? I

ask. No, but it sounds fascinating, says Peeta. I try and animate my face as I recall the event, a true story, in which Id foolishly challenged a black bear over the rights to a beehive. Peeta laughs and asks questions right on cue. Hes much better at this than I am. On the second day, while were taking a shot at spear throwing, he whispers to me. I think we have a shadow. I throw my spear, which Im not too bad at actually, if I dont have to throw too far, and see the little girl from District 11 standing back a bit, watching us. Shes the twelve-year-old, the one who reminded me so of Prim in stature. Up close she looks about ten. She has bright, dark, eyes and satiny brown skin and stands tilted up on her toes with her arms slightly extended to her sides, as if ready to take wing at the slightest sound. Its impossible not to think of a bird. I pick up another spear while Peeta throws. I think her names Rue, he says softly. I bite my lip. Rue is a small yellow flower that grows in the Meadow. Rue. Primrose. Neither of them could tip the scale at seventy pounds soaking wet. What can we do about it? I ask him, more harshly than I intended. Nothing to do, he says back. Just making conversation. Now that I know shes there, its hard to ignore the child. She slips up and joins us at different stations. Like me, shes clever with plants, climbs swiftly, and has good aim. She can hit the target every time with a slingshot. But what is a slingshot against a 220-pound male with a sword? Back on the District 12 floor, Haymitch and Effie grill us throughout breakfast and dinner about every moment of the day. What we did, who watched us, how the other tributes size up.

Cinna and Portia arent around, so theres no one to add any sanity to the meals. Not that Haymitch and Effie are fighting anymore. Instead they seem to be of one mind, determined to whip us into shape. Full of endless directions about what we should do and not do in training. Peeta is more patient, but I become fed up and surly. When we finally escape to bed on the second night, Peeta mumbles, Someone ought to get Haymitch a drink. I make a sound that is somewhere between a snort and a laugh. Then catch myself. Its messing with my mind too much, trying to keep straight when were supposedly friends and when were not. At least when we get into the arena, Ill know where we stand. Dont. Dont lets pretend when theres no one around. All right, Katniss, he says tiredly. After that, we only talk in front of people. On the third day of training, they start to call us out of lunch for our private sessions with the Gamemakers. District by district, first the boy, then the girl tribute. As usual, District 12 is slated to go last. We linger in the dining room, unsure where else to go. No one comes back once they have left. As the room empties, the pressure to appear friendly lightens. By the time they call Rue, we are left alone. We sit in silence until they summon Peeta. He rises. Remember what Haymitch said

about being sure to throw the weights. The words come out of my mouth without permission. Thanks. I will, he says. You . . . Shoot straight. I nod. I dont know why I said anything at all. Although if Im going to lose, Id rather Peeta win than the others. Better for our district, for my mother and Prim. After about fifteen minutes, they call my name. I smooth my hair, set my shoulders back, and walk into the gymnasium. Instantly, I know Im in trouble. Theyve been here too long, the Gamemakers. Sat through twenty-three other demonstrations. Had too much to wine, most of them. Want more than anything to go home. Theres nothing I can do but continue with the plan. I walk to the archery station. Oh, the weapons! Ive been itching to get my hands on them for days! Bows made of wood and plastic and metal and materials I cant even name. Arrows with feathers cut in flawless uniform lines. I choose a bow, string it, and sling the matching quiver of arrows over my shoulder. Theres a shooting range, but its much too limited. Standard bulls-eyes and human silhouettes. I walk to the center of the gymnasium and pick my first target. The dummy used for knife practice. Even as I pull back on the bow I know something is wrong. The strings tighter than the one I use at home. The arrows more rigid. I miss

the dummy by a couple of inches and lose what little attention I had been commanding. For a moment, Im humiliated, then I head back to the bulls-eye. I shoot again and again until I get the feel of these new weapons. Back in the center of the gymnasium, I take my initial position and skewer the dummy right through the heart. Then I sever the rope that holds the sandbag for boxing, and the bag splits open as it slams to the ground. Without pausing, I shoulder-roll forward, come up on one knee, and send an arrow into one of the hanging lights high above the gymnasium floor. A shower of sparks bursts from the fixture. Its excellent shooting. I turn to the Gamemakers. A few are nodding approval, but the majority of them are fixated on a roast pig that has just arrived at their banquet table. Suddenly I am furious, that with my life on the line, they dont even have the decency to pay attention to me. That Im being upstaged by a dead pig. My heart starts to pound, I can feel my face burning. Without thinking, I pull an arrow from my quiver and send it straight at the Gamemakers table. I hear shouts of alarm as people stumble back. The arrow skewers the apple in the pigs mouth and pins it to the wall behind it. Everyone stares at me in disbelief. Thank you for your consideration, I say. Then I give a slight bow and walk

straight toward the exit without being dismissed.

8.

As I stride toward the elevator, I fling my bow to one side and my quiver to the other. I brush past the gaping Avoxes who guard the elevators and hit the number twelve button with my fist. The doors slide together and I zip upward. I actually make it back to my floor before the tears start running down my

cheeks. I can hear the others calling me from the sitting room, but I fly down the hall into my room, bolt the door, and fling myself onto my bed. Then I really begin to sob. Now Ive done it! Now Ive ruined everything! If Id stood even a ghost of chance, it vanished when I sent that arrow flying at the Gamemakers. What will they do to me now? Arrest me? Execute me? Cut my tongue and turn me into an Avox so I can wait on the future tributes of Panem? What was I thinking, shooting at the Gamemakers? Of course, I wasnt, I was shooting at that apple because I was so angry

at being ignored. I wasnt trying to kill one of them. If I were, theyd be dead! Oh, what does it matter? Its not like I was going to win the Games anyway. Who cares what they do to me? What really scares me is what they might do to my mother and Prim, how my family might suffer now because of my impulsiveness. Will they take their few belongings, or send my mother to prison and Prim to the community home, or kill them? They wouldnt kill them, would they? Why not? What do they care? I should have stayed and apologized. Or laughed, like it was a big joke. Then maybe I would have found some leniency. But instead I stalked out of the place in the most disrespectful manner possible. Haymitch and Effie are knocking on my door. I shout for them to go away and eventually they do. It takes at least an hour for me to cry myself out. Then I just lay curled up on the bed, stroking the silken sheets, watching the sun set over the artificial candy Capitol. At first, I expect guards to come for me. But as time passes, it seems less likely. I calm down. They still need a girl tribute from District 12, dont they? If the Gamemakers want to punish me, they can do it publicly. Wait until Im in the arena and sic starving wild animals on me. You can bet theyll make sure I dont have a bow and arrow to defend myself. Before that though, theyll give me a score so low, no one in their right mind would sponsor me. Thats what will happen tonight. Since the training isnt open to viewers, the Gamemakers announce a score for each player. It gives the audience a starting place for the betting that will continue throughout the Games. The number, which is between one and twelve, one being irredeemably bad and twelve being unattainably high, signifies the promise of the tribute. The mark is not a guarantee of which person will win. Its only an indication of the potential a tribute showed in training. Often, because of the variables in the actual arena, high-scoring tributes go down almost immediately. And a few years ago, the boy who won the Games only received a three. Still, the scores can help or hurt an individual tribute in terms of sponsorship. I had been hoping my shooting skills might get me a six or a seven, even if Im not particularly powerful. Now Im sure Ill have the lowest score of the twenty-four. If no one sponsors me, my odds of staying alive decrease to almost zero. When Effie taps on the door to

call me to dinner, I decide I may as well go. The scores will be televised tonight. Its not like I can hide what happened forever. I go to the bathroom and wash my face,

but its still red and splotchy. Everyones waiting at the table, even Cinna and Portia. I wish the stylists hadnt shown up because for some reason, I dont like the idea of disappointing them. Its as if Ive thrown away all the good work they did on the opening ceremonies without a thought. I avoid looking at anyone as I take tiny spoonfuls of fish soup. The saltiness reminds me of my tears. The adults begin some chitchat about the weather forecast, and I let my eyes meet Peetas. He raises his eyebrows. A question. What happened? I just give my head a small shake. Then, as theyre serving the main course, I hear Haymitch say, Okay, enough small talk, just how bad were you today? Peeta jumps in. I dont know that it mattered. By the time I showed up, no one even bothered to look at me. They were singing some kind of drinking song, I think. So, I threw around some heavy objects until they told me I could go. That makes me feel a bit better. Its not like Peeta attacked the Gamemakers, but at least he was provoked, too. And you, sweetheart? says Haymitch. Somehow Haymitch calling me sweetheart ticks me off enough that Im at least able to speak. I shot an arrow at the Gamemakers. Everyone stops eating. You what? The horror in Effies voice confirms my worse suspicions. I shot an arrow at them. Not exactly at them. In their direction. Its like Peeta said, I was shooting and they were ignoring me and I just . . . I just lost my head, so I shot an apple out of their stupid roast pigs mouth! I say defiantly. And what did they say? says Cinna carefully. Nothing. Or I dont know. I walked out after that, I say. Without being dismissed? gasps Effie. I dismissed myself, I said. I remember how I promised Prim that I really would try to win and I feel like a ton of coal has dropped on me. Well, thats that, says Haymitch. Then he butters a roll. Do you think theyll arrest me? I ask. Doubt it. Be a pain to replace you at this stage, says Haymitch. What about my family? I say. Will they punish them? Dont think so. Wouldnt make much sense. See theyd have to reveal what happened in the Training Center for it to have any worthwhile effect on the population. People would need to know what you did. But they cant since its secret, so itd be a waste of effort, says Haymitch. More likely theyll make your life hell in the arena. Well, theyve already promised to do that to us any way, says Peeta. Very true, says Haymitch. And I realize the impossible has happened. They have actually cheered me up. Haymitch picks up a pork chop with his fingers, which makes Effie frown, and dunks it in his wine. He rips off a hunk of meat and starts to chuckle.

What were their faces like? I can feel the edges of my mouth tilting up. Shocked. Terrified. Uh, ridiculous, some of them. An image pops into my mind. One man tripped

backward into a bowl of punch. Haymitch guffaws and we all start laughing except Effie, although even she is suppressing a smile. Well, it serves them right. Its their job to pay attention to you. And just because you come from District Twelve is no excuse to ignore you. Then her eyes dart around as if shes said something totally outrageous. Im sorry, but thats what I think, she says to no one in particular. Ill get a very bad score, I say. Scores only matter if theyre very good, no one pays much attention to the bad or mediocre ones. For all they know, you could be hiding your talents to get a low score on purpose. People use that strategy, said Portia. I hope thats how people interpret the four Ill probably get, says Peeta. If that. Really, is anything less impressive than watching a person pick up a heavy ball and throw it a couple of yards. One almost landed on my foot. I grin at him and realize that Im starving. I cut off a piece of pork, dunk it in mashed potatoes, and start eating. Its okay. My family is safe. And if they are safe, no real harm has been done. After dinner, we go to sitting room to watch the scores announced on television. First they show a photo of the tribute, then flash their score below it. The Career Tributes naturally get in the eight-to-ten range. Most of the other players average a five. Surprisingly, little Rue comes up with a seven. I dont know what she showed the judges, but shes so tiny it must have been impressive. District 12 comes up last, as usual. Peeta pulls an eight so at least a couple of the Gamemakers must have been watching him. I dig my fingernails into my palms as my face comes up, expecting the worst. Then theyre flashing the number eleven on the screen. Eleven! Effie Trinket lets out a squeal, and everybody is slapping me on the back and cheering and congratulating me. But it doesnt seem real. There must be a mistake. How . . . How could that happen? I ask Haymitch. Guess they liked your temper, he says. Theyve got a show to put on. They need some players with some heat. Katniss, the girl who was on fire, says Cinna and gives me a hug. Oh, wait until you see your interview dress. More flames? I ask. Of a sort, he says mischievously. Peeta and I congratulate each other, another awkward moment. Weve both done well, but what does that

mean for the other? I escape to my room as quickly as possible and burrow down under the covers. The stress of the day, particularly the crying, has worn me out. I drift off, reprieved, relieved, and with the number eleven still flashing behind my eyelids. At dawn, I lie in bed for a while, watching the sun come up on a beautiful morning. Its Sunday. A day off at home. I wonder if Gale is in the woods yet. Usually we devote all of Sunday to stocking up for the week. Rising early, hunting and gathering, then trading at the Hob. I think of Gale without me. Both of us can hunt alone, but were better as a pair. Particularly if were trying for bigger game. But also in the

littler things, having a partner lightened the load, could even make the arduous task of filling my familys table enjoyable. I had been struggling along on my own for about six months when I first ran into Gale in the woods. It was a Sunday in October, the air cool and pungent with dying things. Id spent the morning competing with the squirrels for nuts and the slightly warmer afternoon wading in shallow ponds harvesting Katniss. The only meat Id shot was a squirrel that had practically run over my toes in its quest for acorns, but the animals would still be afoot when the snow buried my other food sources. Having strayed farther afield than usual, I was hurrying back home, lugging my burlap sacks when I came across a dead rabbit. It was hanging by its neck in a thin wire a foot above my head. About fifteen yards away was another. I recognized the twitch-up snares because my father had used them. When the prey is caught, its yanked into the air out of the reach of other hungry animals. Id been trying to use snares all summer with no success, so I couldnt help dropping my sacks to examine this one. My fingers were just on the wire above one of the rabbits when a voice rang out. Thats dangerous. I jumped back several feet as Gale materialized from behind a tree. He must have been watching me the whole time. He was only fourteen, but he cleared six feet and was as good as an adult to me. Id seen him around the Seam and at school. And one other time. Hed lost his father in the same blast that killed mine. In January, Id stood by while he received his medal of valor in the Justice Building, another oldest child with no father. I remembered his two little brothers clutching his mother, a woman whose swollen belly announced she was just days away from giving birth. Whats your name? he said, coming over and

disengaging the rabbit from the snare. He had another three hanging from his belt. Katniss, I said, barely audible. Well, Catnip, stealings punishable by death, or hadnt you heard? he said. Katniss, I said louder. And I wasnt stealing it. I just wanted to look at your snare. Mine never catch anything. He scowled at me, not convinced. So whered you get the squirrel? I shot it. I pulled my bow off my shoulder. I was still using the small version my father had made me, but Id been practicing with the full-size one when I could. I was hoping that by spring I might be able to bring down some bigger game. Gales eyes fastened on the bow. Can I see that? I handed it over. Just remember, stealings punishable by death. That was the first time I ever saw him smile. It transformed him from someone menacing to someone you wished you knew. But it took several months before I returned that smile. We talked hunting then. I told him I might be able to get him a bow if he had something to trade. Not food. I wanted knowledge. I wanted to set my own snares that caught a belt of fat rabbits in one day. He agreed something might be worked out. As the seasons went by, we grudgingly began to share our knowledge, our weapons, our secret places that were thick with wild plums or turkeys. He taught me snares and fishing. I showed him what plants to eat and eventually gave him one of our precious bows. And then one day, without either of us saying it, we became a team. Dividing the work and the spoils. Making sure that both our families had food. Gale gave me a sense of security Id lacked since my fathers death. His companionship replaced the long solitary hours in the woods. I became a much better hunter when I didnt have to look over my shoulder constantly, when someone was watching my back. But he turned into so much more than a hunting partner. He became my confidante, someone with whom I could share thoughts I could never voice inside the fence. In exchange, he trusted me with his. Being out in the woods with Gale . . . Sometimes I was actually happy. I call him my friend, but in the last year its seemed too casual a word for what Gale is to me. A pang of longing shoots through my chest. If only he was with me now! But, of course, I dont want that. I dont want him in the arena where hed be dead in a few days. I just . . . I just miss him. And I hate being so alone. Does he miss me? He must. I think of the eleven flashing under my name last night. I know exactly what hed say to

me. Well, theres some room for improvement there. And then hed give me a smile and Id return it without hesitating now. I cant help comparing what I have with Gale to what Im pretending to have with Peeta. How I never question Gales motives while I do nothing but doubt the latters. Its not a fair comparison really. Gale and I were thrown together by a mutual need to survive. Peeta and I know the others survival means our own death. How do you sidestep that? Effies knocking at the door, reminding me theres another big, big, big day! ahead. Tomorrow night will be our televised interviews. I guess the whole team will have their hands full readying us for that. I get up and take a quick shower, being a bit more careful about the buttons I hit, and head down to the dining room. Peeta, Effie, and Haymitch are huddled around the table talking in hushed voices. That seems odd, but hunger wins out over curiosity and I load up my plate with breakfast before I join them. The stews made with tender chunks of lamb and dried plums today. Perfect on the bed of wild rice. Ive shoveled about halfway through the mound when I realize no ones talking. I take a big gulp of orange juice and wipe my mouth. So, whats going on? Youre coaching us on interviews today, right? Thats right, says Haymitch. You dont have to wait until Im done. I can listen and cat at the same time, I say. Well, theres been a change of plans. About our current approach, says Haymitch. Whats that? I ask. Im not sure what our current approach is. Trying to appear mediocre in front of the other tributes is the last bit of strategy I remember. Haymitch shrugs. Peeta has asked to be coached

separately.

9.

Betrayal.

Thats the first thing I feel, which is ludicrous. For there to be betrayal, there would have had to been trust first. Between Peeta and me. And trust has not been part of the agreement. Were tributes. But the boy who risked a beating to give me bread, the one who steadied me in the chariot, who covered for me with the

redheaded Avox girl, who insisted Haymitch know my hunting skills . . . Was there some part of me that couldnt help trusting him? On the other hand, Im relieved that we can stop the pretense of being friends. Obviously, whatever thin connection wed foolishly formed has been severed. And high time, too. The Games begin in two days, and trust will only be a weakness. Whatever triggered Peetas decision and I suspect it had to do with my outperforming him in training I should be nothing but grateful for it. Maybe hes finally accepted the fact that the sooner we openly acknowledge that we are enemies, the better. Good, I say. So whats the schedule? Youll each have four hours with Effie for presentation and four with me for content, says Haymitch. You start with Effie, Katniss. I cant imagine what Effie will have to teach me that could take four hours, but shes got me working down to the last minute. We go to my rooms and she puts me in a full-length gown and high-heeled shoes, not the ones Ill he wearing for the actual interview, and instructs me on walking. The shoes are the worst part. Ive never worn high heels and cant get used to essentially wobbling around on the balls of my feet. But Effie runs around in them full-time, and Im determined that if she can do it, so can I. The dress poses anotherproblem. It keeps tangling around my shoes so, of course, I hitch it up, and then Effie swoops down on me like a hawk, smacking my hands and yelling, Not above the ankle! When I finally conquer walking, theres still sitting, posture apparently I have a tendency to duck my head eye contact, hand gestures, and smiling. Smiling is mostly about smiling more. Effie makes me say a hundred banal phrases starting with a smile, while smiling, or ending with a smile. By lunch, the muscles in my cheeks are twitching from overuse. Well, thats the best I can do, Effie says with a sigh. Just remember, Katniss, you want the audience to like you. And you dont think they will? I ask. Not if you glare at them the entire time. Why dont you save that for the arena? Instead, think of yourself among friends, says Effie. Theyre betting on how long Ill live! I burst out. Theyre not my friends! Well, try and pretend! snaps Effie. Then she composes herself and beams at me. See, like this. Im smiling at you even though youre aggravating me. Yes, it feels very convincing, I say. Im going to eat. 1 kick off my heels and stomp down to the dining room, hiking my skirt up to my thighs. Peeta and Haymitch seem in pretty good moods, so Im thinking the content session should be an improvement over the morning. I couldnt be more wrong. After lunch,

Haymitch takes me into the

sitting room, directs me to the couch, and then just frowns at me for a while. What? I finally ask. Im trying to figure out what to do with you, he says. How were going to present you. Are you going to be charming? Aloof? Fierce? So far, youre shining like a star. You volunteered to save your sister. Cinna made you look unforgettable. Youve got the top training score. People are intrigued, but no one knows who you are. The impression you make tomorrow will decide exactly what I can get you in terms of sponsors, says Haymitch. Having watched the tribute interviews all my life, I know theres truth to what hes saying. If you appeal to the crowd, either by being humorous or brutal or eccentric, you gain favor. Whats Peetas approach? Or am I not allowed to ask? I say. Likable. He has a sort of self-deprecating humor naturally, says Haymitch. Whereas when you open your mouth, you come across more as sullen and hostile. I do not! I say. Please. I dont know where you pulled that cheery, wavy girl on the chariot from, but I havent seen her before or since, says Haymitch. And youve given me so many reasons to be cheery, I counter.But you dont have to please me. Im not going to sponsor you. So pretend Im the audience, says Haymitch. Delight me. Fine! I snarl. Haymitch takes the role of the interviewer and I try to answer his questions in a winning fashion. But I cant. Im too angry with Haymitch for what he said and that I even have to answer the questions. All I can think is how unjust the whole thing is, the Hunger Games. Why am I hopping around like some trained dog trying to please people I hate? The longer the interview goes on, the more my fury seems to rise to the surface, until Im literally spitting out answers at him. All right, enough, he says. Weve got to find another angle. Not only are you hostile, I dont know anything about you. Ive asked you fifty questions and still have no sense of your life, your family, what you care about. They want to know about you, Katniss. But I dont want them to! Theyre already taking my future! They cant have the things that mattered to me in the past! I say. Then lie! Make something up! says Haymitch. Im not good at lying, I say. Well, you better learn fast. Youve got about as much charm as a dead slug, says Haymitch. Ouch. That hurts. Even Haymitch must know hes been too harsh because his voice softens. Heres an idea. Try acting humble. Humble, I echo. That you cant believe a little girl from District

Twelve has done this well. The whole things been more than you ever could have dreamed of. Talk about Cinnas clothes. How nice the people are. How the city amazes you. If you wont talk about yourself, at least compliment the audience. Just keep turning it back around, all right. Gush. The next hours are agonizing. At once, its clear I cannot gush. We try me playing cocky, but I just dont have the arrogance. Apparently, Im too vulnerable for ferocity. Im not witty. Funny. Sexy. Or mysterious. By the end of the

session, I am no one at all. Haymitch started drinking somewhere around witty, and a nasty edge has crept into his voice. I give up, sweetheart. Just answer the questions and try not to let the audience see how openly you despise them. I have dinner that night in my room, ordering an outrageous number of delicacies, eating myself sick, and then taking out my anger at Haymitch, at the Hunger Games, at every living being in the Capitol by smashing dishes around my room. When the girl with the red hair comes in to turn down my bed, her eyes widen at the mess. Just leave it! I yell at her. Just leave it alone! I hate her, too, with her knowing reproachful eyes that call me a coward, a monster, a puppet of the Capitol, both now and then. For her, justice must finally be happening. At least my death will help pay for the life of the boy in the woods. But instead of fleeing the room, the girl closes the door behind her and goes to the bathroom. She comes back with a damp cloth and wipes my face gently then cleans the blood from a broken plate off my hands. Why is she doing this? Why am I letting her? I should have tried to save you, I whisper. She shakes her head. Does this mean we were right to stand by? That she has forgiven me? No, it was wrong, I say. She taps her lips with her fingers then points to my chest. I think she means that I would just have ended up an Avox, too. Probably would have. An Avox or dead. I spend the next hour helping the redheaded girl clean the room. When all the garbage has been dropped down a disposal and the food cleaned away, she turns down my bed. I crawl in between the sheets like a five-year-old and let her tuck me in. Then she goes. I want her to stay until I fall asleep. To be there when I wake up. I want the protection of this girl, even though she never had mine. In the morning, its not the girl but my prep team who are hanging over me. My lessons with Effie and Haymitch are over. This day belongs to Cinna. Hes my last hope. Maybe he

can make me look so wonderful, no one will care what comes out of my mouth. The team works on me until late afternoon, turning my skin to glowing satin, stenciling patterns on my arms, painting flame designs on my twenty perfect nails. Then Venia goes to work on my hair, weaving strands of red into a pattern that begins at my left ear, wraps around my head, and then falls in one braid down my right shoulder. They erase my face with a layer of pale makeup and draw my features back out. Huge dark eyes, full red lips, lashes that throw off bits of light when I blink. Finally, they cover my entire body in a powder that makes me shimmer in gold dust. Then Cinna enters with what I assume is my dress, but I cant really see it because its covered. Close your eyes, he orders. I can feel the silken inside as they slip it down over my naked body, then the weight. It must be forty pounds. I clutch Octavias hand as I blindly step into my shoes, glad to find they are at least two inches lower than

the pair Effie had me practice in. Theres some adjusting and fidgeting. Then silence. Can I open my eyes? I ask. Yes, says Cinna. Open them. The creature standing before me in the full-length mirror has come from another world. Where skin shimmers and eyes flash and apparently they make their clothes from jewels. Because my dress, oh, my dress is entirely covered in reflective precious gems, red and yellow and white with bits of blue that accent the tips of the flame design. The slightest movement gives the impression I am engulfed in tongues of fire. I am not pretty. I am not beautiful. I am as radiant as the sun. For a while, we all just stare at me. Oh, Cinna, I finally whisper. Thank you. Twirl for me, he says. I hold out my arms and spin in a circle. The prep team screams in admiration. Cinna dismisses the team and has me move around in the dress and shoes, which are infinitely more manageable than Effies. The dress hangs in such a way that I dont have to lift the skirt when I walk, leaving me with one less thing to worry about. So, all ready for the interview then? asks Cinna. I can see by his expression that hes been talking to Haymitch. That he knows how dreadful I am. Im awful. Haymitch called me a dead slug. No matter what we tried, I couldnt do it. I just cant be one of those people he wants me to be, I say. Cinna thinks about this a moment. Why dont you just be yourself? Myself? Thats no good, either. Haymitch says Im sullen and hostile, I say. Well, you are . . . Around Haymitch, says Cinna with a grin. I dont find you so. The

prep team adores you. You even won over the Gamemakers. And as for the citizens of the Capitol, well, they cant stop talking about you. No one can help but admire your spirit. My spirit. This is a new thought. Im not sure exactly what it means, but it suggests Im a fighter. In a sort of brave way. Its not as if Im never friendly. Okay, maybe I dont go around loving everybody I meet, maybe my smiles are hard to come by, but I do care for some people. Cinna takes my icy hands in his warm ones. Suppose, when you answer the questions, you think youre addressing a friend back home. Who would your best friend be? asks Cinna. Gale, I say instantly. Only it doesnt make sense, Cinna. I would never be telling Gale those things about me. He already knows them. What about me? Could you think of me as a friend? asks Cinna. Of all the people Ive met since I left home, Cinna is by far my favorite. I liked him right off and he hasnt disappointed me yet. I think so, but Ill be sitting on the main platform with the other stylists. Youll be able to look right at me. When youre asked a question, find me, and answer it as honestly as possible, says Cinna. Even if what I think is horrible? I ask. Because it might be, really. Especially if what you think is horrible, says Cinna. Youll try it? I nod. Its a plan. Or at least a straw to grasp at.

Too soon its time to go. The interviews take place on a stage constructed in front of the

Training Center. Once I leave my room, it will be only minutes until Im in front of the crowd, the cameras, all of Panem. As Cinna turns the doorknob, I stop his hand. Cinna . . . Im completely overcome with stage fright. Remember, they already love you, he says gently. Just be yourself. We meet up with the rest of the District 12 crowd at the elevator. Portia and her gang have been hard at work. Peeta looks striking in a black suit with flame accents. While we look well together, its a relief not to be dressed identically. Haymitch and Effie are all fancied up for the occasion. I avoid Haymitch, but accept Effies compliments. Effie can be tiresome and clueless, but shes not destructive like Haymitch. When the elevator opens, the other tributes are being lined up to take the stage. All twenty-four of us sit in a big arc throughout the interviews. Ill be last, or second to last since the girl tribute precedes the boy from each district. How I wish I could be first and get the whole thing out of the way! Now Ill have to listen to how witty, funny, humble, fierce, and charming everybody

else is before I go up. Plus, the audience will start to get bored, just as the Gamemakers did. And I cant exactly shoot an arrow into the crowd to get their attention. Right before we parade onto the stage, Haymitch comes up behind Peeta and me and growls, Remember, youre still a happy pair. So act like it. What? I thought we abandoned that when Peeta asked for separate coaching. But I guess that was a private, not a public thing. Anyway, theres not much chance for interaction now, as we walk single-file to our seats and take our places. Just stepping on the stage makes my breathing rapid and shallow. I can feel my pulse pounding in my temples. Its a relief to get to my chair, because between the heels and my legs shaking, Im afraid Ill trip. Although evening is falling, the City Circle is brighter than a summers day. An elevated seating unit has been set up for prestigious guests, with the stylists commanding the front row. The cameras will turn to them when the crowd is reacting to their handiwork. A large balcony off a building to the right has been reserved for the Gamemakers. Television crews have claimed most of the other balconies. But the City Circle and the avenues that feed into it are completely packed with people. Standing room only. At homes and community halls around the country, every television set is turned on. Every citizen of Panem is tuned in. There will be no blackouts tonight. Caesar Flickerman, the man who has hosted the interviews for more than forty years, bounces onto the stage. Its a little scary because his appearance has been virtually unchanged during all that time. Same face under a coating of pure white makeup. Same hairstyle that he dyes a different color for each Hunger Games. Same ceremonial suit, midnight blue dotted with a thousand tiny electric bulbs that twinkle like stars. They do surgery in the Capitol, to make people appear

younger and thinner. In District 12, looking old is something of an achievement since so many people die early. You see an elderly person you want to congratulate them on their longevity, ask the secret of survival. A plump person is envied because they arent scraping by like the majority of us. But here it is different. Wrinkles arent desirable. A round belly isnt a sign of success. This year, Caesars hair is powder blue and his eyelids and lips are coated in the same hue. He looks freakish but less frightening than he did last year when his color was crimson and he seemed to be

bleeding. Caesar tells a few jokes to warm up the audience but then gets down to business. The girl tribute from District 1, looking provocative in a see-through gold gown, steps up the center of the stage to join Caesar for her interview. You can tell her mentor didnt have any trouble coming up with an angle for her. With that flowing blonde hair, emerald green eyes, her body tall and lush . . . Shes sexy all the way. Each interview only lasts three minutes. Then a buzzer goes off and the next tribute is up. Ill say this for Caesar, he really does his best to make the tributes shine. Hes friendly, tries to set the nervous ones at ease, laughs at lame jokes, and can turn a weak response into a memorable one by the way he reacts. I sit like a lady, the way Effie showed me, as the districts slip by. 2, 3, 4. Everyone seems to be playing up some angle. The monstrous boy from District 2 is a ruthless killing machine. The fox-faced girl from District 5 sly and elusive. I spotted Cinna as soon as he took his place, but even his presence cannot relax me. 8, 9, 10. The crippled boy from 10 is very quiet. My palms are sweating like crazy, but the jeweled dress isnt absorbent and they skid right of if I try to dry them. 11. Rue, who is dressed in a gossamer gown complete with wings, flutters her way to Caesar. A hush falls over the crowd at the sight of this magical wisp of a tribute. Caesars very sweet with her, complimenting her seven in training, an excellent score for one so small. When he asks her what her greatest strength in the arena will be, she doesnt hesitate. Im very hard to catch, she says in a tremulous voice. And if they cant catch me, they cant kill me. So dont count me out. I wouldnt in a million years, says Caesar encouragingly. The boy tribute from District 11, Thresh, has the same dark skin as Rue, but the resemblance stops there. Hes one of the giants, probably six and a half feet tall and built like an ox, but I noticed he rejected the invitations from the Career Tributes to join their crowd. Instead hes been very solitary, speaking to no one, showing little interest in training. Even so, he scored a ten and its not hard to imagine he impressed the Gamemakers. He ignores Caesars attempts at banter and answers with a yes or no or just remains silent. If only I was his size, I could get away with sullen and hostile and it would be just fine! I bet half the

sponsors are at least considering him. If I had any money, Id bet on him myself. And then theyre calling Katniss Everdeen, and I feel myself, as if in a dream,

standing and making my way center stage. I shake Caesars outstretched hand, and he has the good grace not to immediately wipe his off on his suit. So, Katniss, the Capitol must be quite a change from District Twelve. Whats impressed you most since you arrived here? asks Caesar. What? What did he say? Its as if the words make no sense. My mouth has gone as dry as sawdust. I desperately find Cinna in the crowd and lock eyes with him. I imagine the words coming from his lips. Whats impressed you most since you arrived here? I rack my brain for something that made me happy here. Be honest, I think. Be honest. The lamb stew, I get out. Caesar laughs, and vaguely I realize some of the audience has joined in. The one with the dried plums? asks Caesar. I nod. Oh, I eat it by the bucketful. He turns sideways to the audience in horror, hand on his stomach. It doesnt show, does it? They shout reassurances to him and applaud. This is what I mean about Caesar. He tries to help you out. Now, Katniss, he says confidentially, When you came out in the opening ceremonies, my heart actually stopped. What did you think of that costume? Cinna raises one eyebrow at me. Be honest. You mean after I got over my fear of being burned alive? I ask. Big laugh. A real one from the audience. Yes. Start then, says Caesar. Cinna, my friend, I should tell him anyway. I thought Cinna was brilliant and it was the most gorgeous costume Id ever seen and I couldnt believe I was wearing it. I cant believe Im wearing this, either. I lift up my skirt to spread it out. I mean, look at it! As the audience oohs and ahs, I see Cinna make the tiniest circular motion with his finger. But I know what hes saying. Twirl for me. I spin in a circle once and the reaction is immediate. Oh, do that again! says Caesar, and so I lift up my arms and spin around and around letting the skirt fly out, letting the dress engulf me in flames. The audience breaks into cheers. When I stop, I clutch Caesars arm. Dont stop! he says. I have to, Im dizzy! Im also giggling, which I think Ive done maybe never in my lifetime. But the nerves and the spinning have gotten to me. Caesar wraps a protective arm around me. Dont worry, Ive got you. Cant have you following in your mentors footsteps. Everyones hooting as the cameras find Haymitch, who is by now famous for his head dive at the reaping, and he waves them away good-naturedly and points back to me. Its all right, Caesar reassures the crowd. Shes safe with me. So, how about that training score. E-le-ven. Give us a hint what happened in there. I glance at the Gamemakers on the balcony and bite my lip. Um . . . All I can say, is I

think it was a first. The cameras are right on the Gamemakers, who are chuckling and nodding. Youre killing us, says Caesar as if in actual pain. Details. Details. I address the

balcony. Im not supposed to talk about it, right? The Gamemaker who fell in the punch bowl shouts out, Shes not! Thank you, I say. Sorry. My lips are sealed. Lets go back then, to the moment they called your sisters name at the reaping, says Caesar. His mood is quieter now. And you volunteered. Can you tell us about her? No. No, not all of you. But maybe Cinna. I dont think Im imagining the sadness on his face. Her names Prim. Shes just twelve. And I love her more than anything. You could hear a pin drop in the City Circle now. What did she say to you? After the reaping? Caesar asks. Be honest. Be honest. I swallow hard. She asked me to try really hard to win. The audience is frozen, hanging on my every word. And what did you say? prompts Caesar gently. But instead of warmth, I feel an icy rigidity take over my body. My muscles tense as they do before a kill. When I speak, my voice seems to have dropped an octave. I swore I would. I bet you did, says Caesar, giving me a squeeze. The buzzer goes off. Sorry were out of time. Best of luck, Katniss Everdeen, tribute from District Twelve. The applause continues long after Im seated. I look to Cinna for reassurance. He gives me a subtle thumbs-up. Im still in a daze for the first part of Peetas interview. He has the audience from the get-go, though; I can hear them laughing, shouting out. He plays up the bakers son thing, comparing the tributes to the breads from their districts. Then has a funny anecdote about the perils of the Capitol showers. Tell me, do I still smell like roses? he asks Caesar, and then theres a whole run where they take turns sniffing each other that brings down the house. Im coming back into focus when Caesar asks him if he has a girlfriend back home. Peeta hesitates, then gives an unconvincing shake of his head. Handsome lad like you. There must be some special girl. Come on, whats her name? says Caesar. Peeta sighs. Well, there is this one girl. Ive had a crush on her ever since I can remember. But Im pretty sure she didnt know I was alive until the reaping. Sounds of sympathy from the crowd. Unrequited love they can relate to. She have another fellow? asks Caesar. I dont know, but a lot of boys like her, says Peeta. So, heres what you do. You win, you go home. She cant turn you down then, eh? says Caesar

encouragingly. I dont think its going to work out. Winning . . . Wont help in my case, says Peeta. Why ever not? says Caesar, mystified. Peeta blushes beet red and stammers out. Because . . . Because . . . She came here with me.

PART II"THE GAMES"

10.

For a moment, the cameras hold on Peetas downcast eyes as what he says sinks in. Then I can see my face, mouth half open in a mix of surprise and protest, magnified on every screen as I realize, Me! He means me! I press my lips together and stare at the floor, hoping this will conceal the emotions starting to boil up inside of me. Oh, that is a piece of bad luck, says Caesar, and theres a real edge of pain in his voice. The crowd is murmuring in agreement, a few have even given agonized cries. Its not good, agrees Peeta. Well, I dont think any of us can blame you. Itd be hard not to fall for that young lady, says Caesar. She didnt know? Peeta shakes his head. Not until now. I allow my eyes to flicker up to the screen long enough to see that the blush on my cheeks is unmistakable. Wouldnt you love to pull her back out here and get a response? Caesar asks the audience. The crowd screams assent. Sadly, rules are rules, and Katniss Everdeens time has been spent. Well, best of luck to you, Peeta Mellark, and I think I speak for all of Panem when I say our hearts go with yours. The roar of the crowd is deafening. Peeta has absolutely wiped the rest of us off the map with his declaration of love for me. When the audience finally settles down, he chokes out a quiet Thank you and returns to his seat. We stand for the anthem. I have to raise my head out of the required respect and cannot avoid seeing that every screen is now dominated by a shot of Peeta and me, separated by a few feet that in the viewers heads can never be breached. Poor tragic us. But I know better. After the anthem, the tributes file back into the Training Center lobby and onto the elevators. I make sure to veer into a car that does not contain Peeta. The crowd slows our entourages of stylists and mentors and chaperones, so we have only each other for company. No one speaks. My elevator stops to deposit four tributes before I am alone and then find the doors opening on the twelfth floor. Peeta has only just stepped from his car when

I slam my palms into his chest. He loses his balance and crashes into an ugly urn filled with fake flowers. The urn tips and shatters into hundreds of tiny pieces. Peeta lands in the shards, and blood immediately flows from his hands. What was that for? he says, aghast. You had no right! No right to go saying those things about me! I shout at him. Now the elevators open and the whole crew is there, Effie, Haymitch, Cinna, and Portia. Whats going on? says Effie, a note of hysteria in her voice. Did you fall? After she shoved me, says Peeta as Effie and Cinna help him up. Haymitch turns on me. Shoved him? This was your idea, wasnt it? Turning me into some kind of fool in front of the entire country? I answer. It was my idea, says Peeta, wincing as he pulls spikes of pottery from his palms. Haymitch just helped me with it. Yes, Haymitch is very helpful. To you! I say. You are a fool, Haymitch says in disgust. Do you think he hurt you? That boy just gave you

something you could never achieve on your own. He made me look weak! I say. He made you look desirable! And lets face it, you can use all the help you can get in that department. You were about as romantic as dirt until he said he wanted you.

Now they all do. Youre all theyre talking about. The star-crossed lovers from District Twelve! says Haymitch. But were not star-crossed lovers! I say. Haymitch grabs my shoulders and pins me against the wall. Who cares? Its all a big show. Its all how youre perceived. The most I could say about you after your interview was that you were nice enough, although that in itself was a small miracle. Now I can say youre a heartbreaker. Oh, oh, oh, how the boys back home fall longingly at your feet. Which do you think will get you more sponsors? The smell of wine on his breath makes me sick. I shove his hands off my shoulders and step away, trying to clear my head. Cinna comes over and puts his arm around me. Hes right, Katniss. I dont know what to think. I should have been told, so I didnt look so stupid. No, your reaction was perfect. If youd known, it wouldnt have read as real, says Portia. Shes just worried about her boyfriend, says Peeta gruffly, tossing away a bloody piece of the urn. My cheeks burn again at the thought of Gale. I dont have a boyfriend. Whatever, says Peeta. But I bet hes smart enough to know a bluff when he sees it. Besides you didnt say you loved me. So what does it matter? The words are sinking in. My anger fading. Im torn now between thinking Ive been used and thinking Ive been given an

edge. Haymitch is right. I survived my interview, but what was I really? A silly girl spinning in a sparkling, dress. Giggling. The only moment of any substance I hail was when I talked about Prim. Compare that with Thresh, his silent, deadly power, and Im forgettable. Silly and sparkly and forgettable. No, not entirely forgettable, I have my eleven in training. But now Peeta has made me an object of love. Not just his. To hear him tell it I have many admirers. And if the audience really thinks were in love . . . I remember how strongly they responded to his confession. Star-crossed lovers. Haymitch is right, they eat that stuff up in the Capitol. Suddenly Im worried that I didnt react properly. After he said he loved me, did you think I could be in love with him, too? I ask. I did, says Portia. The way you avoided looking at the cameras, the blush. They others chime in, agreeing. Youre golden, sweetheart. Youre going to have sponsors lined up around the block, says Haymitch. Im embarrassed about my reaction. I force myself to acknowledge Peeta. Im sorry I shoved you. Doesnt matter, he shrugs. Although its technically illegal. Are your hands okay? I ask. Theyll be all right, he says. In the silence that follows, delicious smells of our dinner waft in from the dining room. Come on, lets eat, says Haymitch. We all follow him to the table and

take our places. But then Peeta is bleeding too heavily, and Portia

leads him off for medical treatment. We start the cream and rose-petal soup without them. By the time weve finished, theyre back. Peetas hands are wrapped in bandages. I cant help feeling guilty. Tomorrow we will be in the arena. He has done me a favor and I have answered with an injury. Will I never stop owing him? After dinner, we watch the replay in the sitting room. I seem frilly and shallow, twirling and giggling in my dress, although the others assure me I am charming. Peeta actually is charming and then utterly winning as the boy in love. And there I am, blushing and confused, made beautiful by Cinnas hands, desirable by Peetas confession, tragic by circumstance, and by all accounts, unforgettable. When the anthem finishes and the screen goes dark, a hush falls on the room. Tomorrow at dawn, we will be roused and prepared for the arena. The actual Games dont start until ten because so many of the Capitol residents rise late. But Peeta and I must make an early start. There is no telling how far we will travel to the arena that has been prepared for this years Games. I know Haymitch and Effie will not be going with us. As soon as they leave

here, theyll be at the Games Headquarters, hopefully madly signing up our sponsors, working out a strategy on how and when to deliver the gifts to us. Cinna and Portia will travel with us to the very spot from which we will be launched into the arena. Still final good-byes must be said here. Effie takes both of us by the hand and, with actual tears in her eyes, wishes us well. Thanks us for being the best tributes it has ever been her privilege to sponsor. And then, because its Effie and shes apparently required by law to say something awful, she adds I wouldnt be at all surprised if I finally get promoted to a decent district next year! Then she kisses us each on the cheek and hurries out, overcome with either the emotional parting or the possible improvement of her fortunes. Haymitch crosses his arms and looks us both over. Any final words of advice? asks Peeta. When the gong sounds, get the hell out of there. Youre neither of you up to the blood bath at the Cornucopia. Just clear out, put as much distance as you can between yourselves and the others, and find a source of water, he says. Got it? And after that? I ask. Stay alive, says Haymitch. Its the same advice he gave us on the train, but hes not drunk and laughing this time. And we only nod. What else is there to say? When I head to my room, Peeta lingers to

talk to Portia. Im glad. Whatever strange words of parting we exchange can wait until tomorrow. My covers are drawn back, but there is no sign of the redheaded Avox girl. I wish I knew her name. I should have asked it. She could write it down maybe. Or act it out. But perhaps that would only result in punishment for her. I take a shower and scrub the gold paint, the makeup, the scent of beauty from my body. All that remains of the design-teams efforts are the flames on my nails. I decide to

keep them as reminder of who I am to the audience. Katniss, the girl who was on fire. Perhaps it will give me something to hold on to in the days to come. I pull on a thick, fleecy nightgown and climb into bed. It takes me about five seconds to realize Ill never fall asleep. And I need sleep desperately because in the arena every moment I give in to fatigue will be an invitation to death. Its no good. One hour, two, three pass, and my eyelids refuse to get heavy. I cant stop trying to imagine exactly what terrain Ill be thrown into. Desert? Swamp? A frigid wasteland? Above all I am hoping for trees, which may afford me some means of concealment and food and shelter, Often there are trees because barren landscapes are dull and the Games resolve too

quickly without them. But what will the climate be like? What traps have the Gamemakers hid den to liven up the slower moments? And then there are my fellow tributes . . . The more anxious I am to find sleep, the more it eludes me. Finally, I am too restless to even stay in bed. I pace the floor, heart beating too fast, breathing too short. My room feels like a prison cell. If I dont get air soon, Im going to start to throw things again. I run down the hall to the door to the roof. Its not only unlocked but ajar. Perhaps someone forgot to close it, but it doesnt matter. The energy field enclosing the roof prevents any desperate form of escape. And Im not looking to escape, only to fill my lungs with air. I want to see the sky and the moon on the last night that no one will be hunting me. The roof is not lit at night, but as soon as my bare feel reach its tiled surface I see his silhouette, black against the lights that shine endlessly in the Capitol. Theres quite a commotion going on down in the streets, music and singing and car horns, none of which I could hear through the thick glass window panels in my room. I could slip away now, without him noticing me; he wouldnt hear me over the din, But the night airs so sweet, I cant bear returning to that stuffy cage of a room. And what difference does it make? Whether we speak or

not? My feet move soundlessly across the tiles. Im only yard behind him when I say, You should be getting some sleep. He starts but doesnt turn. I can see him give his head a slight shake. I didnt want to miss the party. Its for us, after all. I come up beside him and lean over the edge of the rail. The wide streets are full of dancing people. I squint to make out their tiny figures in more detail. Are they in costumes? Who could tell? Peeta answers. With all the crazy clothes they wear here. Couldnt sleep, either? Couldnt turn my mind off, I say. Thinking about your family? he asks. No, I admit a bit guiltily. All I can do is wonder about tomorrow. Which is pointless, of course. In the light from below, I can see his face now, the awkward way he holds his bandaged hands. I really am sorry about your hands. It doesnt matter, Katniss, he says. Ive never been a contender in these

Games anyway. Thats no way to be thinking, I say. Why not? Its true. My best hope is to not disgrace myself and . . . He hesitates. And what? I say. I dont know how to say it exactly. Only . . . I want to die as myself. Does that make any sense? he asks. I shake my head. How could he die as anyone but himself? I dont want them to change

me in there. Turn me into some kind of monster that Im not. I bite my lip feeling inferior. While Ive been ruminating on the availability of trees, Peeta has been struggling with how to maintain his identity. His purity of self. Do you mean you wont kill anyone? I ask. No, when the time comes, Im sure Ill kill just like everybody else. I cant go down without a fight. Only I keep wishing I could think of a way to . . . To show the Capitol they dont own me. That Im more than just a piece in their Games, says Peeta. But youre not, I say. None of us are. Thats how the Games work. Okay, but within that framework, theres still you, theres still me, he insists. Dont you see? A little. Only . . . No offense, but who cares, Peeta? I say. I do. I mean, what else am I allowed to care about at this point? he asks angrily. Hes locked those blue eyes on mine now, demanding an answer. I take a step back. Care about what Haymitch said. About staying alive. Peeta smiles at me, sad and mocking. Okay. Thanks for the tip, sweetheart. Its like a slap in the face. His use of Haymitchs patronizing endearment. Look, if you want to spend the last hours of your life planning some noble death in the arena, thats your choice. I want to spend mine in District Twelve. Wouldnt surprise me if you do, says Peeta. Give my mother my best when you make it back, will you?

Count on it, I say. Then I turn and leave the roof. I spend the rest of the night slipping in and out of a doze, imagining the cutting remarks I will make to Peeta Mellark in the morning. Peeta Mellark. We will see how high and mighty he is when he's faced with life and death. He'll probably turn into one of those raging beast tributes, the kind who tries to eat someone's heart after they've killed them. There was a guy like that a few years ago from District 6 called Titus. He went completely savage and the Gamemakers had to have him stunned with electric guns to collect the bodies of the players he'd killed before he ate them. There are no rules in the arena, but cannibalism doesn't play well with the Capitol audience, so they tried to head it off. There was some speculation that the avalanche that finally took Titus out was specifically engineered to ensure the victor was not a lunatic. I don't see Peeta in the morning. Cinna comes to me before dawn, gives me a simple shift to wear, and guides me to the roof. My final dressing and preparations will be alone in the catacombs under the arena itself. A hovercraft appears out of thin air, just like the one did in the woods the day I saw the redheaded Avox girl captured, and a ladder drops down. I place my hands and feet on the lower


rungs and instantly it's as if I'm frozen. Some sort of current glues me to the ladder while I'm lifted safely inside. I expect the ladder to release me then, but I'm still stuck when a woman in a white coat approaches me carrying a syringe. "This is just your tracker, Katniss. The stiller you are, the more efficiently I can place it, " she says. Still? I'm a statue. But that doesn't prevent me from feeling the sharp stab of pain as the needle inserts the metal tracking device deep under the skin on the inside of my forearm. Now the Gamemakers will always be able to trace my whereabouts in the arena. Wouldnt want to lose a tribute. As soon as the trackers in place, the ladder releases me. The woman disappears and Cinna is retrieved from the roof, An Avox boy comes in and directs us to a room where breakfast has been laid out. Despite the tension in my stomach, I eat as much as I can, although none of the delectable food makes any impression on me. Im so nervous, I could be eating coal dust. The one thing that distracts me at all is the view from the windows as we sail over the city and then to the wilderness beyond. This is what birds see. Only theyre free and safe. The very opposite of me. The ride lasts about half an hour before the windows black out, suggesting that were nearing the arena. The hovercraft lands and Cinna and I go back

to the ladder, only this time it leads down into a tube underground, into the catacombs that lie beneath the arena. We follow instructions to my destination, a chamber for my preparation. In the Capitol, they call it the Launch Room. In the districts, its referred to as the Stockyard. The place animals go before slaughter. Everything is brand-new, I will be the first and only tribute to use this Launch Room. The arenas are historic sites, preserved after the Games. Popular destinations for Capitol residents to visit, to vacation. Go for a month, rewatch the Games, tour the catacombs, visit the sites where the deaths took place. You can even take part in reenactments. They say the food is excellent. I struggle to keep my breakfast down as I shower and clean my teeth. Cinna does my hair in my simple trademark braid down my back. Then the clothes arrive, the same for every tribute. Cinna has had no say in my outfit, does not even know what will be in the package, but he helps me dress in the undergarments, simple tawny pants, light green blouse, sturdy brown belt, and thin, hooded black jacket that falls to my thighs. The material in the jackets designed to reflect body heat. Expect some cool nights, he says. The boots, worn over skintight socks, are better than I could have hoped for. Soft leather not unlike my ones at

home. These have a narrow flexible rubber sole with treads though. Good for running. I think Im finished when Cinna pulls the gold mockingjay pin from his pocket. I had completely forgotten about it. Where did you get that? I ask. Off the green outfit you wore on the train, he says. I remember now

taking it off my mothers dress, pinning it to the shirt. Its your district token, right? I nod and he fastens it on my shirt. It barely cleared the review board. Some thought the pin could be used as a weapon, giving you an unfair advantage. But eventually, they let it through, says Cinna. They eliminated a ring from that District One girl, though. If you twisted the gemstone, a spike popped out. Poisoned one. She claimed she had no knowledge the ring transformed and there was no way to prove she did. But she lost her token. There, youre all set. Move around. Make sure everything feels comfortable. I walk, run in a circle, swing my arms about. Yes, its fine. Fits perfectly. Then theres nothing to do but wait for the call, says Cinna. Unless you think you could eat any more? I turn down food but accept a glass of water that I take tiny sips of as we wait on a couch. I dont want to chew on my nails or lips, so I

find myself gnawing on the inside of my cheek. It still hasnt fully healed from a few days ago. Soon the taste of blood fills my mouth. Nervousness seeps into terror as I anticipate what is to come. I could be dead, flat-out dead, in an hour. Not even. My fingers obsessively trace the hard little lump on my forearm where the woman injected the tracking device. I press on it, even though it hurts, I press on it so hard a small bruise begins to form. Do you want to talk, Katniss? Cinna asks. I shake my head but after a moment hold out my hand to him. Cinna encloses it in both of his. And this is how we sit until a pleasant female voice announces its time to prepare for launch. Still clenching one of Cinnas hands, I walk over and stand on the circular metal plate. Remember what Haymitch said. Run, find water. The rest will follow, he says. I nod. And remember this. Im not allowed to bet, but if I could, my money would be on you. Truly? I whisper. Truly, says Cinna. He leans down and kisses me on the forehead. Good luck, girl on fire. And then a glass cylinder is lowering around me, breaking our handhold, cutting him off from me. He taps his fingers under his chin. Head high. I lift my chin and stand as straight as I can. The cylinder begins to rise. For maybe fifteen seconds, Im in darkness and then I can feel the metal plate pushing

me out of the cylinder, into the open air. For a moment, my eyes are dazzled by the bright sunlight and Im conscious only of a strong wind with the hopeful smell of pine trees. Then I hear the legendary announcer, Claudius Templesmith, as his voice booms all around me. Ladies and gentlemen, let the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games begin!

11.

Sixty seconds. Thats how long were required to stand on our metal circles before the sound of a gong releases us. Step off before the minute is up, and land mines blow your legs off. Sixty seconds to take in the ring of tributes all equidistant from the Cornucopia, a giant golden horn shaped like a cone with a curved tail, the mouth of which is at least twenty feet high, spilling over with

the things that will give us life here in the arena. Food, containers of water, weapons, medicine, garments, fire starters. Strewn around the Cornucopia are other supplies, their value decreasing the farther they are from the horn. For instance, only a few steps from my feet lays a three-foot square of plastic. Certainly it could be of some use in a downpour. But there in the mouth, I can see a tent pack that would protect from almost any sort of weather. If I had the guts to go in and fight for it against the other twenty-three tributes. Which I have been instructed not to do. Were on a flat, open stretch of ground. A plain of hard-packed dirt. Behind the tributes across from me, I can see nothing, indicating either a steep downward slope or even cliff. To my right lies a lake. To my left and back, spars piney woods. This is where Haymitch would want me to go. Immediately. I hear his instructions in my head. Just clear out, put as much distance as you can between yourselves and the others, and find a source of water. But its tempting, so tempting, when I see the bounty waiting there before me. And I know that if I dont get it, someone else will. That the Career Tributes who survive the bloodbath will divide up most of these life-sustaining spoils. Something catches my eye. There, resting on a mound of blanket rolls, is a silver sheath of arrows and a bow, already strung, just waiting to be engaged. Thats mine, I think. Its meant for me. Im fast. I can sprint faster than any of

the girls in our school although a couple can beat me in distance races. But this forty-yard length, this is what I am built for. I know I can get it, I know I can reach it first, but then the question is how quickly can I get out of there? By the time Ive scrambled up the packs and grabbed the weapons, others will have reached the horn, and one or two I might be able to pick off, but say theres a dozen, at that close range, they could take me down with the spears and the clubs. Or their own powerful fists. Still, I wont be the only target. Im betting many of the other tributes would pass up a smaller girl, even one who scored an eleven in training, to take out their more fierce adversaries. Haymitch has never seen me run. Maybe if he had hed tell me to go for it. Get the weapon. Since thats the very weapon that might be my salvation. And I only see one bow in that whole pile. I know the minute must be almost up and will have to decide what my strategy will be and I find myself positioning my feet to run, not away into the stir rounding forests but toward the pile, toward the bow. When suddenly I notice Peeta, hes about five tributes to my right, quite a fair distance, still I can tell hes looking at me and I think he might be shaking his head. But the suns in my eyes, and while Im puzzling over it the gong rings out. And Ive missed it! Ive missed my chance! Because those extra couple of seconds Ive lost by not being ready are enough to change my mind about going in. My

feet shuffle for a moment, confused at the direction my brain wants to take and then I lunge forward, scoop up the sheet of plastic and a loaf of bread. The pickings are so small and Im so angry with Peeta for distracting me that I sprint in twenty yards to retrieve a bright orange backpack that could hold anything because I cant stand leaving with virtually nothing. A boy, I think from District 9, reaches the pack at the same time I do and for a brief time we grapple for it and then he coughs, splattering my face with blood. I stagger back, repulsed by the warm, sticky spray. Then the boy slips to the ground. Thats when I see the knife in his back. Already other tributes have reached the Cornucopia and are spreading out to attack. Yes, the girl from District 2, ten yards away, running toward me, one hand clutching a half-dozen knives. Ive seen her throw in training. She never misses. And Im her next target. All the general fear Ive been feeling condenses into at immediate fear of this girl, this predator who might kill me in seconds. Adrenaline shoots through me and I sling the

pack over one shoulder and run full-speed for the woods. I can hear the blade whistling toward me and reflexively hike the pack up to protect my head. The blade lodges in the pack. Both straps on my shoulders now, I make for the trees. Somehow I know the girl will not pursue me. That shell be drawn back into the Cornucopia before all the good stuff is gone. A grin crosses my face. Thanks for the knife, I think. At the edge of the woods I turn for one instant to survey the field. About a dozen or so tributes are hacking away at one another at the horn. Several lie dead already on the ground. Those who have taken flight are disappearing into the trees or into the void opposite me. I continue running until the woods have hidden me from the other tributes then slow into a steady jog that I think I can maintain for a while. For the next few hours, I alternate between jogging and walking, putting as much distance as I can between myself and my competitors. I lost my bread during the struggle with the boy from District 9 but managed to stuff my plastic in my sleeve so as I walk I fold it neatly and tuck it into a pocket. I also free the knife its a fine one with a long sharp blade, serrated near the handle, which will make it handy for sawing through things and slide it into my belt. I dont dare stop to examine the contents of the pack yet. I just keep moving, pausing only to check for pursuers. I can go a long time. I know that from my days in the woods. But I will need water. That was Haymitchs second instruction, and since I sort of botched the first, I keep a sharp eye out for any sign of it. No luck. The woods begin to evolve, and the pines are intermixed with a variety of trees, some I recognize, some completely foreign to me. At one point, I hear a noise and pull my knife, thinking I may have to defend myself, but Ive only startled a rabbit. Good to see you, I whisper. If

theres one rabbit, there could be hundreds just waiting to be snared. The ground slopes down. I dont particularly like this. Valleys make me feel trapped. I want to be high, like in the hills around District 12, where I can see my enemies approaching. But I have no choice but to keep going. Funny though, I dont feel too bad. The days of gorging myself have paid off. Ive got staying power even though Im short on sleep. Being in the woods is rejuvenating. Im glad for the solitude, even though its an illusion, because Im probably on-screen right now. Not consistently but off and on. There are so many deaths to show the first day that a tribute trekking

through the woods isnt much to look at. But theyll show me enough to let people know Im alive, uninjured and on the move. One of the heaviest days of betting is the opening, when the initial casualties come in. But that cant compare to what happens as the field shrinks to a handful of players. Its late afternoon when I begin to hear the cannons. Each shot represents a dead tribute. The fighting must have finally stopped at the Cornucopia. They never collect the bloodbath bodies until the killers have dispersed. On the opening day, they dont even fire the cannons until the initial fightings over because its too hard to keep track of the fatalities. I allow myself to pause, panting, as I count the shots. One . . . Two . . . Three . . . On and on until they reach eleven. Eleven dead in all. Thirteen left to play. My fingernails scrape at the dried blood the boy from District 9 coughed into my face. Hes gone, certainly. I wonder about Peeta. Has he lasted through the day? Ill know in a few hours. When they project the deads images into the sky for the rest of us to see. All of a sudden, Im overwhelmed by the thought that Peeta may be already lost, bled white, collected, and in the process of being transported back to the Capitol to be cleaned up, redressed, and shipped in a simple wooden box back to District 12. No longer here.Heading home. I try hard to remember if I saw him once the action started. But the last image I can conjure up is Peeta shaking his head as the gong rang out. Maybe its better, if hes gone already. He had no confidence he could win. And I will not end up with the unpleasant task of killing him. Maybe its better if hes out of this for good. I slump down next to my pack, exhausted. I need to go through it anyway before night falls. See what I have to work with. As I unhook the straps, I can feel its sturdily made although a rather unfortunate color. This orange will practically glow in the dark. I make a mental note to camouflage it first thing tomorrow. I flip open the flap. What I want most, right at this moment, is water. Haymitchs directive to immediately find water was not arbitrary. I wont last long without it. For a few days, Ill be able to function with unpleasant symptoms of dehydration, but after that I'll deteriorate into helplessness and be dead in a week, tops. I

carefully lay out the provisions. One thin black sleeping bag that reflects body heal. A pack of crackers. A pack of dried beef strips. A bottle of iodine. A box of wooden matches. A small coil of wire. A pair of sunglasses. And a half-gallon plastic

bottle with a cap for carrying water that's bone dry. No water. How hard would it have been for them to fill up the bottle? I become aware of the dryness in my throat and mouth, the cracks in my lips. I've been moving all day long. It's been hot and I've sweat a lot. I do this at home, but there are always streams to drink from, or snow to melt if it should come to it. As I refill my pack I have an awful thought. The lake. The one I saw while I was waiting for the gong to sound. What if that's the only water source in the arena? That way they'll guarantee drawing us in to fight. The lake is a full day's journey from where I sit now, a much harder journey with nothing to drink. And then, even if I reach it, it's sure to be heavily guarded by some of the Career Tributes. I'm about to panic when I remember the rabbit I startled earlier today. It has to drink, too. I just have to find out where. Twilight is closing in and I am ill at ease. The trees are too thin to offer much concealment. The layer of pine needles that muffles my footsteps also makes tracking animals harder when I need their trails to find water. And I'm still heading downhill, deeper and deeper into a valley that seems endless. Im hungry, too, but I dont dare break into my precious store of crackers and beef yet. Instead, I take my knife and go to work on a pine tree, cutting away the outer bark and scraping off a large handful of the softer inner bark. I slowly chew the stuff as I walk along. After a week of the finest food in the world, its a little hard to choke down. But Ive eaten plenty of pine in my life. Ill adjust quickly. In another hour, its clear Ive got to find a place to camp. Night creatures are coming out. I can hear the occasional hoot or howl, my first clue that Ill be competing with natural predators for the rabbits. As to whether Ill be viewed as a source of food, its too soon to tell. There could be any number of animals stalking me at this moment. But right now, I decide to make my fellow tributes a priority. Im sure many will continue hunting through the night. Those who fought it out at the Cornucopia will have food, an abundance of water from the lake, torches or flashlights, and weapons theyre itching to use. I can only hope Ive traveled far and fast enough to be out of range. Before settling down, I take my wire and set two twitch-up snares in the brush. I know its risky to be setting traps, but food will go so fast out here. And I cant set snares on the run. Still, I walk another five minutes before making camp. I pick my tree carefully. A willow, not terribly tall but set in a clump of other willows, offering concealment in those long, flowing tresses. I climb up, sticking to the stronger

branches close to

the trunk, and find a sturdy fork for my bed. It takes some doing, but I arrange the sleeping bag in a relatively comfortable manner. I place my backpack in the foot of the bag, then slide in after it. As a precaution, I remove my belt, loop it all the way around the branch and my sleeping bag, and refasten it at my waist. Now if I roll over in my sleep, I wont go crashing to the ground. Im small enough to tuck the top of the bag over my head, but I put on my hood as well. As night falls, the air is cooling quickly. Despite the risk I took in getting the backpack, I know now it was the right choice. This sleeping bag, radiating back and preserving my body heat, will be invaluable. Im sure there are several other tributes whose biggest concern right now is how to stay warm whereas I may actually be able to get a few hours of sleep. If only I wasnt so thirsty . . . Night has just come when I hear the anthem that proceeds the death recap. Through the branches I can see the seal of the Capitol, which appears to be floating in the sky. Im actually viewing another screen, an enormous one thats transported by of one of their disappearing hovercraft. The anthem fades out and the sky goes dark for a moment. At home, we would be watching full coverage of each and every killing, but thats thought to give an unfair advantage to the living tributes. For instance, if I got my hands on the bow and shot someone, my secret would be revealed to all. No, here in the arena, all we see are the same photographs they showed when they televised our training scores. Simple head shots. But now instead of scores they post only district numbers. I take a deep breath as the face of the eleven dead tributes begin and tick them off one by one on my fingers. The first to appear is the girl from District 3. That means that the Career Tributes from 1 and 2 have all survived. No surprise there. Then the boy from 4. I didnt expect that one, usually all the Careers make it through the first day. The boy from District 5 . . . I guess the fox-faced girl made it. Both tributes from 6 and 7. The boy from 8. Both from 9. Yes, theres the boy who I fought for the backpack. Ive run through my fingers, only one more dead tribute to go. Is it Peeta? No, theres the girl from District 10. Thats it. The Capitol seal is back with a final musical flourish. Then darkness and the sounds of the forest resume. Im relieved Peetas alive. I tell myself again that if I get killed, his winning will benefit my mother and Prim the most. This is what I tell

myself to explain the conflicting emotions that arise when I think of Peeta. The gratitude that he gave me an edge by professing his love for me in the interview. The anger at his superiority on the roof. The dread that we may come face-to-face at any moment in this arena. Eleven dead, but none from District 12. I try to work out who is left. Five Career Tributes. Foxface. Thresh and Rue. Rue . . . So she made it through the first day after all. I cant

help feeling glad. That makes ten of us. The other three Ill figure out tomorrow. Now when it is dark, and I have traveled far, and I am nestled high in this tree, now I must try and rest. I havent really slept in two days, and then theres been the long days journey into the arena. Slowly, I allow my muscles to relax. My eyes to close. The last thing I think is its lucky I dont snore. . . . Snap! The sound of a breaking branch wakes me. How long have I been asleep? Four hours? Five? The tip of my nose is icy cold. Snap! Snap! Whats going on? This is not the sound of a branch under someones foot, but the sharp crack of one coming from a tree. Snap! Snap! I judge it to be several hundred yards to my right. Slowly, noiselessly, I turn myself in that direction. For a few minutes, theres nothing but blackness and some scuffling. Then I see a spark and a small fire begins to bloom. A pair of hands warms over flames, but I cant make out more than that. I have to bite my lip not to scream every foul name I know at the fire starter. What are they thinking? A fire Ill just at nightfall would have been one thing. Those who battled at the Cornucopia, with their superior strength and surplus of supplies, they couldnt possibly have been near enough to spot the flames then. But now, when theyve probably been combing the woods for hours looking for victims. You might as well be waving a flag and shouting, Come and get me! And here I am a stones throw from the biggest idiot in the Games. Strapped in a tree. Not daring to flee since my general location has just been broadcast to any killer who cares. I mean, I know its cold out here and not everybody has a sleeping bag. But then you grit your teeth and stick it out until dawn! I lay smoldering in my bag for the next couple of hours really thinking that if I can get out of this tree, I wont have the least problem taking out my new neighbor. My instinct has been to flee, not fight. But obviously this persons a hazard. Stupid people are dangerous. And this one probably doesnt have much in the way of weapons while Ive got this excellent knife.

The sky is still dark, but I can feel the first signs of dawn approaching. Im beginning to think we meaning the person whose death Im now devising and me we might actually have gone unnoticed. Then I hear it. Several pairs of feet breaking into a run. The fire starter must have dozed off. Theyre on her before she can escape. I know its a girl now, I can tell by the pleading, the agonized scream that follows. Then theres laughter and congratulations from several voices. Someone cries out, Twelve down and eleven to go! which gets a round of appreciative hoots. So theyre fighting in a pack. Im not really surprised. Often alliances are formed in the early stages of the Games. The strong band together to hunt down the weak then, when the tension becomes too great, begin to turn on one another. I dont have to wonder too hard who has made this alliance. Itll be the remaining Career

Tributes from Districts 1, 2, and 4. Two boys and three girls. The ones who lunched together. For a moment, I hear them checking the girl for supplies. I can tell by their comments theyve found nothing good. I wonder if the victim is Rue but quickly dismiss the thought. Shes much too bright to be building a fire like that. Better clear out so they can get the body before it starts stinking. Im almost certain thats the brutish boy from District 2. There are murmurs of assent and then, to my horror, I hear the pack heading toward me. They do not know Im here. How could they? And Im well concealed in the clump of trees. At least while the sun stays down. Then my black sleeping bag will turn from camouflage to trouble. If they just keep moving, they will pass me and be gone in a minute. But the Careers stop in the clearing about ten yards from my tree. They have flashlights, torches. I can see an arm here, a boot there, through the breaks in the branches. I turn to stone, not even daring to breathe. Have they spotted me? No, not yet. I can tell from their words their minds are elsewhere. Shouldnt we have heard a cannon by now? Id say yes. Nothing to prevent them from going in immediately. Unless she isnt dead. Shes dead. I stuck her myself. Then wheres the cannon? Someone should go back. Make sure the jobs done. Yeah, we dont want to have to track her down twice. I said shes dead! An argument breaks out until one tribute silences the others. Were wasting time! Ill go finish her and lets move on! I almost fall out of the tree. The voice belongs to Peeta.

12.

Thank goodness, I had the foresight to belt myself in. Ive rolled sideways off the fork and Im facing the ground, held in place by the belt, one hand, and my feet straddling the pack inside my sleeping bag, braced against the trunk. There must have been some rustling when I tipped sideways, but the Careers have been too caught up in their own argument to catch it. Go on, then, Lover Boy, says the boy from District 2. See for yourself. I just get a glimpse of Peeta, lit by a torch, heading back to the girl by the fire. His face is swollen with bruises, theres a bloody bandage on one arm, and from the sound of his gait hes limping somewhat. I remember him shaking him his head, telling me not to go into the fight for the supplies, when all along, all along hed planned to throw himself into the thick of things. Just the opposite of what Haymitch had mid him to do. Okay, I can stomach that. Seeing all those supplies was tempting. But this . . . This other thing. This teaming up with the Career wolf pack to hunt down the rest of us. No one from District 12 would think of doing such a thing! Career tributes are overly vicious, arrogant, better fed, but only because theyre the Capitols lapdogs. Universally, solidly hated by all but those from their own districts. I can imagine the things theyre saying about him back home now. And Peeta had the gall to talk to me about disgrace? Obviously, the noble boy on the rooftop

was playing just one more game with me. But this will be his last. I will eagerly watch the night skies for signs of his death, if I dont kill him first myself. The Career tributes are silent until he gets out of ear shot, then use hushed voices. Why dont we just kill him now and get it over with? Let him tag along. Whats the harm? And hes handy with that knife. Is he? Thats news. What a lot of interesting things Im learning about my friend Peeta today. Besides, hes our best chance of finding her. It takes me a moment to register that the her theyre referring to is me. Why? You think she bought into that sappy romance stuff? She might have. Seemed pretty simpleminded to me. Every time I think about her spinning around in that dress, I want to puke. Wish we knew how she got that eleven. Bet you Lover Boy knows. The sound of Peeta returning silences them. Was she dead? asks the boy from District 2. No. But she is

now, says Peeta. Just then, the cannon fires. Ready to move on? The Career pack sets off at a run just as dawn begins to break, and birdsong fills the air. I remain in my awkward position, muscles trembling with exertion for a while longer, then hoist myself back onto my branch. I need to get down, to get going, but for a moment I lie there, digesting what Ive heard. Not only is Peeta with the Careers, hes helping them find me. The simpleminded girl who has to be taken seriously because of her eleven. Because she can use a bow and arrow. Which Peeta knows better than anyone. But he hasnt told them yet. Is he saving that information because he knows its all that keeps him alive? Is he still pretending to love me for the audience? What is going on in his head? Suddenly, the birds fall silent. Then one gives a high-pitched warning call. A single note. Just like the one Gale and I heard when the redheaded Avox girl was caught. High above the dying campfire a hovercraft materializes. A set of huge metal teeth drops down. Slowly, gently, the dead tribute girl is lifted into the hovercraft. Then it vanishes. The birds resume their song. Move, I whisper to myself. I wriggle out of my sleeping bag, roll it up, and place it in the pack. I take a deep breath. While Ive been concealed by darkness and the sleeping bag and the willow

branches, it has probably been difficult for the cameras to get a good shot of me. I know they must be tracking me now though. The minute I hit the ground, Im guaranteed a close-up. The audience will have been beside themselves, knowing I was in the tree, that I overheard the Careers talking, that I discovered Peeta was with them. Until I work out exactly how I want to play that, Id better at least act on top of things. Not perplexed. Certainly not confused or frightened. No, I need to look one step ahead of the game. So as I slide out of the foliage and into the dawn light, I pause a second, giving the cameras time to lock on me. Then I cock my head slightly to the side and give a knowing smile. There! Let them figure out

what that means! Im about to take off when I think of my snares. Maybe its imprudent to check them with the others so close. But have to. Too many years of hunting, I guess. And the lure of possible meat. Im rewarded with one fine rabbit. In no time, Ive cleaned and gutted the animal, leaving the head, feet, tail, skin, and innards, under a pile of leaves. Im wishing for a fire eating raw rabbit can give you rabbit fever, a lesson I learned the hard way when I think of the dead tribute. I hurry

back to her camp. Sure enough, the coals of her dying fire are still hot. I cut up the rabbit, fashion a spit out of branches, and set it over the coals. Im glad for the cameras now. I want sponsors to see I can hunt, that Im a good bet because I wont be lured into traps as easily as the others will by hunger. While the rabbit cooks, I grind up part of a charred branch and set about camouflaging my orange pack. The black tones it down, but I feel a layer of mud would definitely help. Of course, to have mud, Id need water . . . I pull on my gear, grab my spit, kick some dirt over the coals, and take off in the opposite direction the Careers went. I eat half the rabbit as I go, then wrap up the leftovers in my plastic for later. The meat stops the grumbling in my stomach but does little to quench my thirst. Water is my top priority now. As I hike along, I feel certain Im still holding the screen in the Capitol, so Im careful to continue to hide my emotions. But what a good time Claudius Templesmith must be having with his guest commentators, dissecting Peetas behavior, my reaction. What to make of it all? Has Peeta revealed his true colors? How does this affect the betting odds? Will we lose sponsors? Do we even have sponsors? Yes, I feel certain we do, or at least did. Certainly Peeta has thrown a wrench into our star-crossed lover

dynamic. Or has he? Maybe, since he hasnt spoken much about me, we can still get some mileage out of it. Maybe people will think its something we plotted together if I seem like it amuses me now. The sun rises in the sky and even through the canopy it seems overly bright. I coat my lips in some grease from the rabbit and try to keep from panting, but its no use. Its only been a day and Im dehydrating fast. I try and think of everything I know about finding water. It runs downhill, so, in fact, continuing down into this valley isnt a bad thing. If I could just locate a game trail or spot a particularly green patch of vegetation, these might help me along, but nothing seems to change. Theres just the slight gradual slope, the birds, the sameness to the trees. As the day wears on, I know Im headed for trouble. What little urine Ive been able to pass is a dark brown, my head is aching, and theres a dry patch on my tongue that refuses to moisten. The sun hurts my eyes so I dig out my sunglasses, but when I put them on they do something funny to my vision, so I just stuff them back in my pack. Its late afternoon when I think Ive found

help. I spot a cluster of berry bushes and hurry to strip the fruit, to suck the

sweet juices from the skins. But just as Im holding them to my lips, I get a hard look at them. What I thought were blueberries have a slightly different shape, and when I break one open the insides are bloodred. I dont recognize these berries, perhaps they are edible, but Im guessing this is some evil trick on the part of the Gamemakers. Even the plant instructor in the Training Center made a point of telling us to avoid berries unless you were 100 percent sure they werent toxic. Something I already knew, but Im so thirsty it takes her reminder to give me the strength to fling them away. Fatigue is beginning to settle on me, but its not the usual tiredness that follows a long hike. I have to stop and rest frequently, although I know the only cure for what ails me requires continued searching. I try a new tactic climbing a tree as high as I dare in my shaky state to look for any signs of water. But as far as I can see in any direction, theres the same unrelenting stretch of forest. Determined to go on until nightfall, I walk until Im stumbling over my own feet. Exhausted, I haul myself up into a tree and belt myself in. Ive no appetite, but I suck on a rabbit bone just to give my mouth something to do. Night falls, the anthem plays, and high in the sky I see the picture of the girl, who was apparently from District 8. The one Peeta went

back to finish off. My fear of the Career pack is minor compared to my burning thirst. Besides, they were heading away from me and by now they, too, will have to rest. With the scarcity of water, they may even have had to return to the lake for refills. Maybe, that is the only course for me as well. Morning brings distress. My heads throbs with every beat of my heart. Simple movements send stabs of pain through my joints. I fall, rather than jump from the tree. It takes several minutes for me to assemble my gear. Somewhere inside me, I know this is wrong. I should be acting with more caution, moving with more urgency. But my mind seems foggy and forming a plan is hard. I lean back against the trunk of my tree, one finger gingerly stroking the sandpaper surface of my tongue, as I assess my options. How can I get water? Return to the lake. No good. Id never make it. Hope for rain. Theres not a cloud in the sky. Keep looking. Yes, this is my only chance. But then, another thought hits me, and the surge of anger that follows brings me to me senses. Haymitch! He could send me water! Press a button and have it delivered to me in a silver parachute in minutes. I know I must have sponsors, at least one or two who could afford a pint of liquid for me. Yes, its pricey, but these people, theyre made of money. And theyll

be betting on me as well. Perhaps Haymitch doesnt realize how deep my need is. I say in a voice as loud as I dare. Water. I wait, hopefully, for a parachute to descend from the sky. But nothing is forthcoming. Something is wrong.

Am I deluded about having sponsors? Or has Peetas behavior made them all hang back? No, I dont believe it. Theres someone out there who wants to buy me water only Haymitch is refusing to let it go through. As my mentor, he gets to control the flow of gifts from the sponsors. I know he hates me. Hes made that clear enough. But enough to let me die? From this? He cant do that, can he? If a mentor mistreats his tributes, hell be held accountable by the viewers, by the people back in District 12. Even Haymitch wouldnt risk that, would he? Say what you will about my fellow traders in the Hob, but I dont think theyd welcome him back there if he let me die this way. And then where would he get his liquor? So . . . What? Is he trying to make me suffer for defying him? Is he directing all the sponsors toward Peeta? Is he just too drunk to even notice whats going on at the moment? Somehow I dont believe that and I dont believe hes trying to kill me off by neglect, either. He has, in fact, in his own unpleasant way, genuinely been trying to prepare me for this. Then what is going on? I bury my face in my hands. Theres no danger of tears now, I couldnt produce one to save my life. What is Haymitch doing? Despite my anger, hatred, and suspicions, a small voice in the back of my head whispers an answer. Maybe hes sending you a message, it says. A message. Saying what? Then I know. Theres only one good reason Haymitch could be withholding water from me. Because he knows Ive almost found it. I grit my teeth and pull myself to my feet. My backpack seems to have tripled in weight. I find a broken branch that will do for a walking stick and I start off. The suns beating down, even more searing than the first two days. I feel like an old piece of leather, drying and cracking in the heat. Every step is an effort, but I refuse to stop. I refuse to sit down. If I sit, theres a good chance I wont be able to get up again, that I wont even remember my task. What easy prey I am! Any tribute, even tiny Rue, could take me right now, merely shove me over and kill me with my own knife, and Id have little strength to resist. But if anyone is in my part of the woods, they ignore me. The truth is, I feel a million miles from another living soul. Not alone though. No, theyve surely got a camera tracking me now. I think back to

the years of watching tributes starve, freeze, bleed, and dehydrate to death. Unless theres a really good fight going on somewhere, Im being featured. My thoughts turn to Prim. Its likely she wont be watching me live, but theyll show updates at the school during lunch. For her sake, I try to look as least desperate as I can. But by afternoon, I know the end is coming. My legs are shaking and my heart too quick. I keep forgetting, exactly what Im doing. Ive stumbled repeatedly and managed to regain my feet, but when the stick slides out from under me, I finally tumble to the ground unable to get up. I let my eyes close. I have misjudged Haymitch. He has no

intention of helping me at all. This is all right, I think. This is not so bad here. The air is less hot, signifying evenings approach. Theres a slight, sweet scent that reminds me of lilies. My fingers stroke the smooth ground, sliding easily across the top. This is an okay place to die, I think. My fingertips make small swirling patterns in the cool, slippery earth. I love mud, I think. How many times Ive tracked game with the help of its soft, readable surface. Good for bee stings, too. Mud. Mud. Mud! My eyes fly open and I dig my fingers into the earth. It is mud! My nose lifts in the air. And those are lilies! Pond lilies! I crawl now, through the mud, dragging myself toward the scent. Five yards from where I fell, I crawl through a tangle of plants into a pond. Floating on the top, yellow flowers in bloom, are my beautiful lilies. Its all I can do not to plunge my face into the water and gulp down as much as I can hold. But I have just enough sense left to abstain. With trembling hands, I get out my flask and fill it with water. I add what I remember to be the right number of drops of iodine for purifying it. The half an hour of waiting is agony, but I do it. At least, I think its a half an hour, but its certainly as long as I can stand. Slowly, easy now, I tell myself. I take one swallow and make myself wait. Then another. Over the next couple of hours, I drink the entire half gallon. Then a second. I prepare another before I retire to a tree where I continue sipping, eating rabbit, and even indulge in one of my precious crackers. By the time the anthem plays, I feel remarkably better. There are no faces tonight, no tributes died today. Tomorrow Ill stay here, resting, camouflaging my backpack with mud, catching some of those little fish I saw as I sipped, digging up the roots of the pond lilies to make a nice meal. I snuggle down in my sleeping bag, hanging on to my water bottle for dear life, which, of course, it is. A few hours later,

the stampede of feet shakes me from slumber. I look around in bewilderment. Its not yet dawn, but my stinging eyes can see it. It would be hard to miss the wall of fire descending on me.

13.

My first impulse is to scramble from the tree, but Im belted in. Somehow my fumbling fingers release the buckle and I fall to the ground in a heap, still snarled in my sleeping bag. Theres no time for any kind of packing. Fortunately, my backpack and water bottle are already in the bag. I shove in the belt, hoist the bag over my shoulder, and flee. The world has transformed to flame and smoke. Burning branches crack from trees and fall in showers of sparks at my feet. All I can do is follow the others, the rabbits and deer and I even spot a wild dog pack shooting through the woods. I trust their sense of direction because their instincts are sharper than mine. But they are much faster, flying through the underbrush so gracefully as my boots catch on roots and fallen tree limbs, that theres no way I can keep apace with them. The heat is horrible, but worse than the heat is the smoke, which threatens to suffocate me at any moment. I pull the top of my shirt up over my nose, grateful to find it soaked in sweat, and it offers a thin veil of protection. And I run, choking, my bag banging against my back, my face cut with branches that materialize from the gray haze without warning, because I know I am supposed to run. This was no tributes campfire gone out of control, no accidental occurrence. The flames that bear down on me have an unnatural height, a uniformity that marks them as human-made, machine-made, Gamemaker-made. Things have been too quiet today. No deaths, perhaps no fights at all. The audience in the Capitol will be getting bored, claiming that these Games are verging on dullness. This is the one thing the Games must not do. Its not hard to follow the Gamemakers motivation. There is the Career pack and then there are the rest of us, probably spread far and thin across the arena. This fire is designed to flush us out, to drive us together. It may not be the most original device Ive seen, but its very, very effective. I hurdle over a burning log. Not high enough. The tail end of my jacket catches on fire and I have to stop to rip it from my body and stamp out the flames. But I dont dare leave the jacket, scorched and

smoldering as it is, I take the risk of shoving it in my sleeping bag, hoping the lack of air will quell what I havent extinguished. This is all I have, what I carry on my back, and its little enough to survive with. In a matter of minutes, my throat and nose are burning. The coughing begins soon after and my lungs begin to feel as if they are actually being cooked. Discomfort turns to distress until each breath sends a searing pain through my chest. I manage to take cover under a stone outcropping just as the vomiting begins, and I lose my meager supper and whatever water has remained in my stomach. Crouching on my hands and knees, I retch until theres nothing left to come up. I know I need to keep moving, but Im trembling and light-headed now, gasping for air. I allow myself about a spoonful of water to rinse my mouth and spit then take a few swallows from my bottle. You get one minute, I tell myself. One minute to rest. I take the time to reorder my supplies, wad up the sleeping bag, and messily stuff everything into the backpack. My minutes up. I know its time to move on, but the smoke has clouded my thoughts. The swift-footed animals that were my compass have left me behind. I know I havent been in this part of the woods before, there were no sizable rocks like the one Im sheltering against on my earlier travels.

Where are the Gamemakers driving me? Back to the lake? To a whole new terrain filled with new dangers? I had just found a few hours of peace at the pond when this attack began. Would there be any way I could travel parallel to the fire and work my way back there, to a source of water at least? The wall of fire must have an

end and it wont burn indefinitely. Not because the Gamemakers couldnt keep it fueled but because, again, that would invite accusations of boredom from the audience. If I could get back behind the fire line, I could avoid meeting up with the Careers. Ive just decided to try and loop back around, although it will require miles of travel away from the inferno and then a very circuitous route back, when the first fireball blasts into the rock about two feet from my head. I spring out from under my ledge, energized by renewed fear. The game has taken a twist. The fire was just to get us moving, now the audience will get to see some real fun. When I hear the next hiss, I flatten on the ground, not taking time to look. The fireball hits a tree off to my left, engulfing it in flames. To remain still is death. Im barely on my feet before the third ball hits the ground where I was lying, sending a pillar of fire up behind me. Time

loses meaning now as I frantically try to dodge the attacks. I cant see where theyre being launched from, but its not a hovercraft. The angles are not extreme enough. Probably this whole segment of the woods has been armed with precision launchers that are concealed in trees or rocks. Somewhere, in a cool and spotless room, a Gamemaker sits at a set of controls, fingers on the triggers that could end my life in a second. All that is needed is a direct hit. Whatever vague plan I had conceived regarding returning to my pond is wiped from my mind as I zigzag and dive and leap to avoid the fireballs. Each one is only the size of an apple, but packs tremendous power on contact. Every sense I have goes into overdrive as the need to survive takes over. Theres no time to judge if a move is the correct one. When theres a hiss, I act or die. Something keeps me moving forward, though. A lifetime of watching the Hunger Games lets me know that certain areas of the arena are rigged for certain attacks. And that if I can just get away from this section, I might be able to move out of reach of the launchers. I might also then fall straight into a pit of vipers, but I cant worry about that now. How long I scramble along dodging the fireballs I cant say, but the attacks finally begin to abate. Which is good, because Im retching

again. This time its an acidic substance that scalds my throat and makes its way into my nose as well. Im forced to stop as my body convulses, trying desperately to rid itself of the poisons Ive been sucking in during the attack. I wait for the next hiss, the next signal to bolt. It doesnt come. The force of the retching has squeezed tears out of my stinging eyes. My clothes are drenched in sweat. Somehow, through the smoke and vomit, I pick up the scent of singed hair. My hand fumbles to my braid and finds a fireball has seared off at least six inches of it. Strands of blackened hair crumble in my fingers. I stare at them, fascinated by the transformation, when the hissing registers. My muscles react, only not fast enough

this time. The fireball crashes into the ground at my side, but not before it skids across my right calf. Seeing my pants leg on fire sends me over the edge. I twist and scuttle backward on my hands and feet, shrieking, trying to remove myself from the horror. When I finally regain enough sense, I roll the leg back and forth on the ground, which stifles the worst of it. But then, without thinking, I rip away the remaining fabric with my bare hands. I sit on the ground, a few yards from the blaze

set off by the fireball. My calf is screaming, my hands covered in red welts. Im shaking too hard to move. If the Gamemakers want to finish me off, now is the time. I hear Cinnas voice, carrying images of rich fabric and sparkling gems. Katniss, the girl who was on fire. What a good laugh the Gamemakers must be having over that one. Perhaps, Cinnas beautiful costumes have even brought on this particular torture for me. I know he couldnt have foreseen this, must be hurting for me because, in fact, I believe he cares about me. But all in all, maybe showing up stark naked in that chariot would have been safer for me. The attack is now over. The Gamemakers dont want me dead. Not yet anyway. Everyone knows they could destroy us all within seconds of the opening gong. The real sport of the Hunger Games is watching the tributes kill one another. Every so often, they do kill a tribute just to remind the players they can. But mostly, they manipulate us into confronting one another face-to-face. Which means, if I am no longer being fired at, there is at least one other tribute close at hand. I would drag myself into a tree and take cover now if I could, but the smoke is still thick enough to kill me. I make myself stand and begin to limp away from the wall of flames that lights up the sky. It does not seem to be pursuing me any longer, except

with its stinking black clouds. Another light, daylight, begins to softly emerge. Swirls of smoke catch the sunbeams. My visibility is poor. I can see maybe fifteen yards in any direction. A tribute could easily be concealed from me here. I should draw my knife as a precaution, but I doubt my ability to hold it for long. The pain in my hands can in no way compete with that in my calf. I hate burns, have always hated them, even a small one gotten from pulling a pan of bread from the oven. It is the worst kind of pain to me, but I have never experienced anything like this. Im so weary I dont even notice Im in the pool until Im ankle-deep. Its spring-fed, bubbling up out of a crevice in some rocks, and blissfully cool. I plunge my hands into the shallow water and feel instant relief. Isnt that what my mother always says? The first treatment for a burn is cold water? That it draws out the heat? But she means minor burns. Probably shed recommend it for my hands. But what of my calf? Although I have not yet had the courage to examine it, Im guessing that its an injury in a whole different class. I lie on my stomach at edge of the

pool for a while, dangling my hands in the water, examining the little flames on

my fingernails that are beginning to chip off. Good. Ive had enough fire for a lifetime. I bathe the blood and ash from my face. I try to recall all I know about burns. They are common injuries in the Seam where we cook and heat our homes with coal. Then there are the mine accidents. . . . A family once brought in an unconscious young man pleading with my mother to help him. The district doctor whos responsible for treating the miners had written him off, told the family to take him home to die. But they wouldnt accept this. He lay on our kitchen table, senseless to the world. I got a glimpse of the wound on his thigh, gaping, charred flesh, burned clear down to the bone, before I ran from the house. I went to the woods and hunted the entire day, haunted by the gruesome leg, memories of my fathers death. Whats funny was, Prim, whos scared of her own shadow, stayed and helped. My mother says healers are born, not made. They did their best, but the man died, just like the doctor said he would. My leg is in need of attention, but I still cant look at it. What if its as bad as the mans and I can see my bone? Then I remember my mother saying that if a burns severe, the victim might not even feel pain because the nerves would be destroyed. Encouraged by this, I sit up and swing my leg in front of me. I almost faint

at the sight of my calf. The flesh is a brilliant red covered with blisters. I force myself to take deep, slow breaths, feeling quite certain the cameras are on my face. I cant show weakness at this injury. Not if I want help. Pity does not get you aid. Admiration at your refusal to give in does. I cut the remains of the pant leg off at the knee and examine the injury more closely. The burned area is about the size of my hand. None of the skin is blackened. I think its not too bad to soak. Gingerly I stretch out my leg into the pool, propping the heel of my boot on a rock so the leather doesnt get too sodden, and sigh, because this does offer some relief. I know there are herbs, if I could find them, that would speed the healing, but I cant quite call them to mind. Water and time will probably be all I have to work with. Should I be moving on? The smoke is slowly clearing but still too heavy to be healthy. If I do continue away from the fire, wont I be walking straight into the weapons of the Careers? Besides, every time I lift my leg from the water, the pain rebounds so intensely I have to slide it back in. My hands are slightly less demanding. They can handle small breaks from the pool. So I slowly put my gear back in order. First I fill my bottle with the pool water, treat it, and when enough time has passed, begin to rehydrate my body. After a time,

I force myself to nibble on a cracker, which helps settle my stomach. I roll up my sleeping bag. Except for a few black marks, its relatively unscathed. My jackets another matter. Stinking and scorched, at least

a foot of the back beyond repair. I cut off the damaged area leaving me with a garment that comes just to the bottom of my ribs. But the hoods intact and its far better than nothing. Despite the pain, drowsiness begins to take over. Id take to a tree and try to rest, except Id be too easy to spot. Besides, abandoning my pool seems impossible. I neatly arrange my supplies, even settle my pack on my shoulders, but I cant seem to leave. I spot some water plants with edible roots and make a small meal with my last piece of rabbit. Sip water. Watch the sun make its slow arc across the sky. Where would I go anyway that is any safer than here? I lean back on my pack, overcome by drowsiness. If the Careers want me, let them find me, I think before drifting into a stupor. Let them find me. And find me, they do. Its lucky Im ready to move on because when I hear the feet, I have less than a minute head start. Evening has begun to fall. The moment I awake, Im up and running, splashing across the pool,

flying into the underbrush. My leg slows me down, but I sense my pursuers are not as speedy as they were before the fire, either. I hear their coughs, their raspy voices calling to one another. Still, they are closing in, just like a pack of wild dogs, and so I do what I have done my whole life in such circumstances. I pick a high tree and begin to climb. If running hurt, climbing is agonizing because it requires not only exertion but direct contact of my hands on the tree bark. Im fast, though, and by the time theyve reached the base of my trunk, Im twenty feet up. For a moment, we stop and survey one another. I hope they cant hear the pounding of my heart. This could be it, I think. What chance do I have against them? All six are there, the five Careers and Peeta, and my only consolation is theyre pretty beat-up, too. Even so, look at their weapons. Look at their faces, grinning and snarling at me, a sure kill above them. It seems pretty hopeless. But then something else registers. Theyre bigger and stronger than I am, no doubt, but theyre also heavier. Theres a reason its me and not Gale who ventures up to pluck the highest fruit, or rob the most remote bird nests. I must weigh at least fifty or sixty pounds less than the smallest Career. Now I smile. Hows everything with you? I call down cheerfully. This takes them aback, but I know

the crowd will love it. Well enough, says the boy from District 2. Yourself? Its been a bit warm for my taste, I say. I can almost hear the laughter from the Capitol. The airs better up here. Why dont you come on up? Think I will, says the same boy. Here, take this, Cato, says the girl from District 1, and she offers him the silver bow and sheath of arrows. My bow! My arrows! Just the sight of them makes me so angry I want to scream, at myself, at that traitor Peeta for distracting me from having them. I try to make eye contact with him now, but he seems to be intentionally avoiding my gaze as he polishes his knife with the edge

of his shirt. No, says Cato, pushing away the bow. Ill do better with my sword. I can see the weapon, a short, heavy blade at his belt. I give Cato time to hoist himself into the tree before I begin to climb again. Gale always says I remind him of a squirrel the way I can scurry up even the slenderest limb. Part of its my weight, but part of its practice. You have to know where to place your hands and feet. Im another thirty feet in the air when I hear the crack and look down to see Cato flailing as he and a branch go down. He hits the ground hard and Im hoping he possibly broke his neck

when he gets back to his feet, swearing like a fiend. The girl with the arrows, Glimmer I hear someone call her ugh, the names the people in District 1 give their children are so ridiculous anyway Glimmer scales the tree until the branches begin to crack under her feet and then has the good sense to stop. Im at least eighty feet high now. She tries to shoot me and its immediately evident that shes incompetent with a bow. One of the arrows gets lodged in the tree near me though and Im able to seize it. I wave it teasingly above her head, as if this was the sole purpose of retrieving it, when actually I mean to use it if I ever get the chance. I could kill them, everyone of them, if those silver weapons were in my hands. The Careers regroup on the ground and I can hear them growling conspiratorially among themselves, furious I have made them look foolish. But twilight has arrived and their window of attack on me is closing. Finally, I hear Peeta say harshly, Oh, let her stay up there. Its not like shes going anywhere. Well deal with her in the morning. Well, hes right about one thing. Im going nowhere. All the relief from the pool water has gone, leaving me to feel the full potency of my burns. I scoot down to a fork in the tree and clumsily prepare for bed. Put on my jacket. Lay out my sleeping bed. Belt myself in and try to keep from

moaning. The heat of the bags too much for my leg. I cut a slash in the fabric and hang my calf out in the open air. I drizzle water on the wound, my hands. All my bravado is gone. Im weak from pain and hunger but cant bring myself to eat. Even if I can last the night, what will the morning bring? I stare into the foliage trying to will myself to rest, but the burns forbid it. Birds are settling down for the night, singing lullabies to their young. Night creatures emerge. An owl hoots. The faint scent of a skunk cuts through the smoke. The eyes of some animal peer at me from the neighboring tree a possum maybe catching the firelight from the Careers torches. Suddenly, Im up on one elbow. Those are no possums eyes, I know their glassy reflection too well. In fact, those are not animal eyes at all. In the last dim rays of light, I make her out, watching me silently from between the branches. Rue. How long has she been here? The whole time probably. Still and unobserved as the action unfolded beneath her. Perhaps she headed up her tree

shortly before I did, hearing the pack was so close. For a while we hold each others gaze. Then, without even rustling a leaf, her little hand slides into the open and

points to something above my head.

14.

My eyes follow the line of her finger up into the foliage above me. At first, I have no idea what shes pointing to, but then, about fifteen feet up, I make out the vague shape in the dimming light. But of . . . Of what? Some sort of animal? It looks about the size of a raccoon, but it hangs from the bottom of a branch, swaying ever so slightly. Theres something else. Among the familiar evening sounds of the woods, my ears register a low hum. Then I know. Its a wasp nest. Fear shoots through me, but I have enough sense to keep still. After all, I dont know what kind of wasp lives there. It could be the ordinary leave-us-alone-and-well-leave-you-alone type. But these are the Hunger Games, and ordinary isnt the norm. More likely they will be one of the Capitols muttations, tracker jackers. Like the jabberjays, these killer wasps were spawned in a lab and strategically placed, like land mines, around the districts during the war. Larger than regular wasps, they have a distinctive solid gold body and a

sting that raises a lump the size of a plum on contact. Most people cant tolerate more than a few stings. Some die at once. If you live, the hallucinations brought on by the venom have actually driven people to madness. And theres another thing, these wasps will hunt down anyone who disturbs their nest and attempt to kill them. Thats where the tracker part of the name comes from. After the war, the Capitol destroyed all the nests surrounding their city, but the ones near the districts were left untouched. Another reminder of our weakness, I suppose, just like the Hunger Games. Another reason to keep inside the fence of District 12. When Gale and I come across a tracker jacker nest, we immediately head in the opposite direction. So is that what hangs above me? I look back to Rue for help, but shes melted into her tree. Given my circumstances, I guess it doesnt matter what type of wasp nest it is. Im wounded and trapped. Darkness has given me a brief reprieve, but by the time the sun rises, the Careers will have formulated a plan to kill me. Theres no way they could do otherwise after Ive made them look so stupid. That nest may be the sole option I have left. If I can drop it down on them, I may be able to escape. But Ill risk my life in the process. Of course, Ill never be able to get in close enough to the actual nest to

cut it free. Ill have to saw off the branch at the trunk and send the whole thing down. The serrated portion of my knife should be able to manage that. But can my hands? And will the vibration from the sawing raise the swarm? And what if the Careers figure out what Im doing and move their camp? That would defeat the whole purpose. I realize that the best chance Ill have to do the sawing without drawing notice will be during the

anthem. That could begin any time. I drag myself out of my bag, make sure my knife is secured in my belt, and begin to make my way up the tree. This in itself is dangerous since the branches are becoming precariously thin even for me, but I persevere. When I reach the limb that supports the nest, the humming becomes more distinctive. But its still oddly subdued if these are tracker jackers. Its the smoke, I think. Its sedated them. This was the one defense the rebels found to battle the wasps. The seal of the Capitol shines above me and the anthem blares out. Its now or never, I think, and begin to saw. Blisters burst on my right hand as I awkwardly drag the knife back and forth. Once Ive got a groove, the work requires less effort but is almost

more than I can handle. I grit my teeth and saw away occasionally glancing at the sky to register that there were no deaths today. Thats all right. The audience will be sated seeing me injured and treed and the pack below me. But the anthems running out and Im only three quarters of the way through the wood when the music ends, the sky goes dark, and Im forced to stop. Now what? I could probably finish off the job by sense of feel but that may not be the smartest plan. If the wasps are too groggy, if the nest catches on its way down, if I try to escape, this could all be a deadly waste of time. Better, I think, to sneak up here at dawn and send the nest into my enemies. In the faint light of the Careers torches, I inch back down to my fork to find the best surprise Ive ever had. Sitting on my sleeping bag is a small plastic pot attached to a silver parachute. My first gift from a sponsor! Haymitch must have had it sent in during the anthem. The pot easily fits in the palm of my hand. What can it be? Not food surely. I unscrew the lid and I know by the scent that its medicine. Cautiously, I probe the surface of the ointment. The throbbing in my fingertip vanishes. Oh, Haymitch, I whisper. Thank you. He has not abandoned me. Not left me to fend entirely for myself. The cost of this medicine must be astronomical. Probably

not one but many sponsors have contributed to buy this one tiny pot. To me, it is priceless. I dip two fingers in the jar and gently spread the balm over my calf. The effect is almost magical, erasing the pain on contact, leaving a pleasant cooling sensation behind. This is no herbal concoction that my mother grinds up out of woodland plants, its high-tech medicine brewed up in the Capitols labs. When my calf is treated, I rub a thin layer into my hands. After wrapping the pot in the parachute, I nestle it safely away in my pack. Now that the pain has eased, its all I can do to reposition myself in my bag before I plunge into sleep. A bird perched just a few feet from me alerts me that a new day is dawning. In the gray morning light, I examine my hands. The medicine has transformed all the angry red patches to a soft baby-skin pink. My leg still feels inflamed, but that burn was far deeper.

I apply another coat of medicine and quietly pack up my gear. Whatever happens, Im going to have to move and move fast. I also make myself eat a cracker and a strip of beef and drink a few cups of water. Almost nothing stayed in my stomach yesterday, and Im already starting to feel the effects of hunger. Below me, I

can see the Career pack and Peeta asleep on the ground. By her position, leaning up against the trunk of the tree, Id guess Glimmer was supposed to be on guard, but fatigue overcame her. My eyes squint as they try to penetrate the tree next to me, but I cant make out Rue. Since she tipped me off, it only seems fair to warn her. Besides, if Im going to die today, its Rue I want to win. Even if it means a little extra food for my family, the idea of Peeta being crowned victor is unbearable. I call Rues name in a hushed whisper and the eyes appear, wide and alert, at once. She points up to the nest again. I hold up my knife and make a sawing motion. She nods and disappears. Theres a rustling in a nearby tree. Then the same noise again a bit farther off. I realize shes leaping from tree to tree. Its all I can do not to laugh out loud. Is this what she showed the Gamemakers? I imagine her flying around the training equipment never touching the floor. She should have gotten at least a ten. Rosy streaks are breaking through in the east. I cant afford to wait any longer. Compared to the agony of last nights climb, this one is a cinch. At the tree limb that holds the nest, I position the knife in the groove and Im about to draw the teeth across the wood when I see something moving. There, on the nest. The bright gold

gleam of a tracker jacker lazily making its way across the papery gray surface. No question, its acting a little subdued, but the wasp is up and moving and that means the others will be out soon as well. Sweat breaks out on the palms of my hands, beading up through the ointment, and I do my best to pat them dry on my shirt. If I dont get through this branch in a matter of seconds, the entire swarm could emerge and attack me. Theres no sense in putting it off. I take a deep breath, grip the knife handle and bear down as hard as I can. Back, forth, back, forth! The tracker jackers begin to buzz and I hear them coming out. Back, forth, back, forth! A stabbing pain shoots through my knee and I know one has found me and the others will be honing in. Back, forth, back, forth. And just as the knife cuts through, I shove the end of the branch as far away from me as I can. It crashes down through the lower branches, snagging temporarily on a few but then twisting free until it smashes with a thud on the ground. The nest bursts open like an egg, and a furious swarm of tracker jackers takes to the air. I feel a second sting on the cheek, a third on my neck, and their venom almost immediately makes me woozy. I cling to the tree with one arm while I rip the barbed stingers out of my flesh. Fortunately, only these three tracker jackers had

identified me before the nest went down. The rest of the insects have targeted their enemies on the ground. Its mayhem. The Careers have woken to a full-scale tracker jacker attack. Peeta and a few others have the sense to drop everything and bolt. I can hear cries of To the lake! To the lake! and know they hope to evade the wasps by taking to the water. It must be close if they think they can outdistance the furious insects. Glimmer and another girl, the one from District 4, are not so lucky. They receive multiple stings before theyre even out of my view. Glimmer appears to go completely mad, shrieking and trying to bat the wasps off with her bow, which is pointless. She calls to the others for help but, of course, no one returns. The girl from District 4 staggers out of sight, although I wouldnt bet on her making it to the lake. I watch Glimmer fall, twitch hysterically around on the ground for a few minutes, and then go still. The nest is nothing but an empty shell. The wasps have vanished in pursuit of the others. I dont think theyll return, but I dont want to risk it. I scamper down the tree and hit the ground running in the opposite direction of the lake. The poison from the stingers makes me wobbly, but I find my way back to my own little pool and submerge myself in the water, just in case any wasps are still on my trail.

After about five minutes, I drag myself onto the rocks. People have not exaggerated the effects of the tracker jacker stings. Actually, the one on my knee is closer to an orange than a plum in size. A foul-smelling green liquid oozes from the places where I pulled out the stingers. The swelling. The pain. The ooze. Watching Glimmer twitching to death on the ground. Its a lot to handle before the sun has even cleared the horizon. I dont want to think about what Glimmer must look like now. Her body disfigured. Her swollen fingers stiffening around the bow . . . The bow! Somewhere in my befuddled mind one thought connects to another and Im on my feet, teetering through the trees back to Glimmer. The bow. The arrows. I must get them. I havent heard the cannons fire yet, so perhaps Glimmer is in some sort of coma, her heart still struggling against the wasp venom. But once it stops and the cannon signals her death, a hovercraft will move in and retrieve her body, taking the only bow and sheath of arrows Ive seen out of the Games for good. And I refuse to let them slip through my fingers again! I reach Glimmer just as the cannon fires. The tracker jackers have vanished. This girl, so breathtakingly beautiful in her golden dress the night of the interviews, is unrecognizable. Her features eradicated, her

limbs three times their normal size. The stinger lumps have begun to explode, spewing putrid green liquid around her. I have to break several of what used to be her fingers with a stone to free the bow. The sheath of arrows is pinned under her back. I try to roll over her body by pulling on one arm, but the flesh disintegrates

in my hands and I fall back on the ground. Is this real? Or have the hallucinations begun? I squeeze my eyes tight and try to breathe through my mouth, ordering myself not to become sick. Breakfast must stay down, it might be days before I can hunt again. A second cannon fires and Im guessing the girl from District 4 has just died. I hear the birds fall silent and then one give the warning call, which means a hovercraft is about to appear. Confused, I think its for Glimmer, although this doesnt quite make sense because Im still in the picture, still fighting for the arrows. I lurch back onto my knees and the trees around me begin to spin in circles. In the middle of the sky, I spot the hovercraft. I throw myself over Glimmers body as if to protect it but then I see the girl from District 4 being lifted into the air and vanishing. Do this! I command myself. Clenching my jaw, I dig my hands under

Glimmers body, get a hold on what must be her rib cage, and force her onto her stomach. I cant help it, Im hyperventilating now, the whole thing is so nightmarish and Im losing my grasp on whats real. I tug on the silver sheath of arrows, but its caught on something, her shoulder blade, something, and finally yank it free. Ive just encircled the sheath with my arms when I hear the footsteps, several pairs, coming through the underbrush, and I realize the Careers have come back. Theyve come back to kill me or get their weapons or both. But its too late to run. I pull a slimy arrow from the sheath and try to position it on the bowstring but instead of one string I see three and the stench from the stings is so repulsive I cant do it. I cant do it. I cant do it. Im helpless as the first hunter crashes through the trees, spear lifted, poised to throw. The shock on Peetas face makes no sense to me. I wait for the blow. Instead his arm drops to his side. What are you still doing here? he hisses at me. I stare uncomprehendingly as a trickle of water drips off a sting under his ear. His whole body starts sparkling as if hes been dipped in dew. Are you mad? Hes prodding me with the shaft of the spear now. Get up! Get up! I rise, but hes still pushing at me. What? What is going on? He shoves me away from him hard. Run! he screams. Run!

Behind him, Cato slashes his way through the brush. Hes sparkling wet, too, and badly stung under one eye. I catch the gleam of sunlight on his sword and do as Peeta says. Holding tightly to my bow and arrows, banging into trees that appear out of nowhere, tripping and falling as I try to keep my balance. Back past my pool and into unfamiliar woods. The world begins to bend in alarming ways. A butterfly balloons to the size of a house then shatters into a million stars. Trees transform to blood and splash down over my boots. Ants begin to crawl out of the blisters on my hands and I cant shake them free. Theyre climbing up my arms, my neck. Someones screaming, a long high pitched scream that never breaks for breath. I have a vague idea

it might be me. I trip and fall into a small pit lined with tiny orange bubbles that hum like the tracker jacker nest. Tucking my knees up to my chin, I wait for death. Sick and disoriented, Im able to form only one thought: Peeta Mellark just saved my life. Then the ants bore into my eyes and I black out.

15. I enter a nightmare from which I wake repeatedly only to find a greater terror awaiting me. All the things I dread most, all the things I dread for others manifest in such vivid detail I cant help but believe theyre real. Each time I wake, I think, At last, this is over, but it isnt. Its only the beginning of a new chapter of torture. How many ways do I watch Prim die? Relive my fathers last moments? Feel my own body ripped apart? This is the nature of the tracker jacker venom, so carefully created to target the place where fear lives in your brain. When I finally do come to my senses, I lie still, waiting for the next onslaught of imagery. But eventually I accept that the poison must have finally worked its way out of my system, leaving my body wracked and feeble. Im still lying on my side, locked in the fetal position. I lift a hand to my eyes to find them sound, untouched by ants that never existed. Simply stretching out my limbs requires an enormous effort. So many parts of me hurt, it doesnt seem worthwhile taking inventory of them. Very, very slowly I manage to sit up. Im in a shallow hole, not filled with the humming orange bubbles of my hallucination but with old, dead leaves. My clothings damp, but I dont know whether pond water, dew, rain, or sweat is the cause. For a long time, all I can do is take tiny sips from my bottle

and watch a beetle crawl up the side of a honeysuckle bush. How long have I been out? It was morning when I lost reason. Now its afternoon. But the stiffness in my joints suggests more than a day has passed, even two possibly. If so, Ill have no way of knowing which tributes survived that tracker jacker attack. Not Glimmer or the girl from District 4. But there was the boy from District 1, both tributes from District 2, and Peeta. Did they die from the stings? Certainly if they lived, their last days must have been as horrid as my own. And what about Rue? Shes so small, it wouldnt take much venom to do her in. But then again . . . The tracker jackers wouldve had to catch her, and she had a good head start. A foul, rotten taste pervades my mouth, and the water has little effect on it. I drag myself over to the honeysuckle bush and pluck a flower. I gently pull the stamen through the blossom and set the drop of nectar on my tongue. The sweetness spreads through my mouth, down my throat, warming my veins with memories of summer, and my home woods and Gales presence beside me. For some reason, our discussion from that last morning comes back to me. We could do it, you know. What? Leave the district. Run off. Live in the woods. You and I, we could make it. And suddenly, Im not thinking of

Gale but of Peeta and . . .

Peeta! He saved my life! I think. Because by the time we met up, I couldnt tell what was real and what the tracker jacker venom had caused me to imagine. But if he did, and my instincts tell me he did, what for? Is he simply working the Lover Boy angle he initiated at the interview? Or was he actually trying to protect me? And if he was, what was he doing with those Careers in the first place? None of it makes sense. I wonder what Gale made of the incident for a moment and then I push the whole thing out of my mind because for some reason Gale and Peeta do not coexist well together in my thoughts. So I focus on the one really good thing thats happened since I landed in the arena. I have a bow and arrows! A full dozen arrows if you count the one I retrieved in the tree. They bear no trace of the noxious green slime that came from Glimmers body which leads me to believe that might not have been wholly real but they have a fair amount of dried blood on them. I can clean them later, but I do take a minute to shoot a few into a nearby tree. They are more like the weapons in the Training Center than my ones at home, but who cares? That I can work with. The

weapons give me an entirely new perspective on the Games. I know I have tough opponents left to face. But I am no longer merely prey that runs and hides or takes desperate measures. If Cato broke through the trees right now, I wouldnt flee, Id shoot. I find Im actually anticipating the moment with pleasure. But first, I have to get some strength back in my body. Im very dehydrated again and my water supply is dangerously low. The little padding I was able to put on by gorging myself during prep time in the Capitol is gone, plus several more pounds as well. My hip bones and ribs are more prominent than I remember them being since those awful months after my fathers death. And then there are my wounds to contend with burns, cuts, and bruises from smashing into the trees, and three tracker jacker stings, which are as sore and swollen as ever. I treat my burns with the ointment and try dabbing a bit on my stings as well, but it has no effect on them. My mother knew a treatment for them, some type of leaf that could draw out the poison, but she seldom had cause to use it, and I dont even remember its name let alone its appearance. Water first, I think. You can hunt along the way now. Its easy to see the direction I came from by the path of destruction my crazed body made through the foliage. So I walk off in the other

direction, hoping my enemies still lie locked in the surreal world of tracker jacker venom. I cant move too quickly, my joints reject any abrupt motions. But I establish the slow hunters tread I use when tracking game. Within a few minutes, I spot a rabbit and make my first kill with the bow and arrow. Its not my usual clean shot through the eye, but Ill take it. After about an hour, I find a stream, shallow but wide, and more than sufficient for my needs. The suns hot and severe, so while I

wait for my water to purify I strip down to my underclothes and wade into the mild current. Im filthy from head to toe, I try splashing myself but eventually just lay down in the water for a few minutes, letting it wash off the soot and blood and skin that has started to peel off my burns. After rinsing out my clothes and hanging them on bushes to dry, I sit on the bank in the sun for a bit, untangling my hair with my fingers. My appetite returns and I eat a cracker and a strip of beef. With a handful of moss, I polish the blood from my silver weapons. Refreshed, I treat my burns again, braid back my hair, and dress in the damp clothes, knowing the sun will dry them soon enough. Following the stream against its current seems the smartest course of

action. Im traveling uphill now, which I prefer, with a source of fresh water not only for myself but possible game. I easily take out a strange bird that must be some form of wild turkey. Anyway, it looks plenty edible to me. By late afternoon, I decide to build a small fire to cook the meat, betting that dusk will help conceal the smoke and I can quench the fire by nightfall. I clean the game, taking extra care with the bird, but theres nothing alarming about it. Once the feathers are plucked, its no bigger than a chicken, but its plump and firm. Ive just placed the first lot over the coals when I hear the twig snap. In one motion, I turn to the sound, bringing the bow and arrow to my shoulder. Theres no one there. No one I can see anyway. Then I spot the tip of a childs boot just peeking out from behind the trunk of a tree. My shoulders relax and I grin. She can move through the woods like a shadow, you have to give her that. How else could she have followed me? The words come out of my mouth before I can stop them. You know, theyre not the only ones who can form alliances, I say. For a moment, no response. Then one of Rues eyes edges around the trunk. You want me for an ally? Why not? You saved me with those tracker jackers. Youre smart enough to still be alive. And I cant seem to shake you anyway, I say. She blinks at me,

trying to decide. You hungry? I can see her swallow hard, her eye flickering to the meat. Come on then, Ive had two kills today. Rue tentatively steps out into the open. I can fix your stings. Can you? I ask. How? She digs in the pack she carries and pulls out a handful of leaves. Im almost certain theyre the ones my mother uses. Whered you find those? Just around. We all carry them when we work in the orchards. They left a lot of nests there, says Rue. There are a lot here, too. Thats right. Youre District Eleven. Agriculture, I say. Orchards, huh? That must be how you can fly around the trees like youve got wings. Rue smiles. Ive landed on one of the few things shell admit pride in. Well, come on, then. Fix me up. I plunk down by the fire and roll up my pant leg to reveal the sting on my knee. To my surprise, Rue places the handful of leaves into her mouth and begins to chew

them. My mother would use other methods, but its not like we have a lot of options. After a minute or so, Rue presses a gloppy green wad of chewed leaves and spit on my knee. Ohhh. The sound comes out of my mouth before I can stop it. Its as if the leaves are actually leaching the pain right out of the sting. Rue gives a giggle.

Lucky you had the sense to pull the stingers out or youd be a lot worse. Do my neck! Do my cheek! I almost beg. Rue stuffs another handful of leaves in her mouth, and soon Im laughing because the relief is so sweet. I notice a long burn on Rues forearm. Ive got something for that. I set aside my weapons and anoint her arm with the burn medicine. You have good sponsors, she says longingly. Have you gotten anything yet? I ask. She shakes her head. You will, though. Watch. The closer we get to the end, the more people will realize how clever you are. I turn the meat over. You werent joking, about wanting me for an ally? she asks. No, I meant it, I say. I can almost hear Haymitch groaning as I team up with this wispy child. But I want her. Because shes a survivor, and I trust her, and why not admit it? She reminds me of Prim. Okay, she says, and holds out her hand. We shake. Its a deal. Of course, this kind of deal can only be temporary, but neither of us mentions that. Rue contributes a big handful of some sort of starchy root to the meal. Roasted over the fire, they have the sharp sweet taste of a parsnip. She recognizes the bird, too, some wild thing they call a groosling in her district. She says sometimes a flock will wander into the orchard and they get a decent lunch that day. For a while, all conversation stops as

we fill our stomachs. The groosling has delicious meal thats so fatty, the grease drips down your face when you bite into it. Oh, says Rue with a sigh. Ive never had a whole leg to myself before. Ill bet she hasnt. Ill bet meat hardly ever comes her way. Take the other, I say. Really? she asks. Take whatever you want. Now that Ive got a bow and arrows, I can get more. Plus Ive got snares. I can show you how to set them, I say. Rue still looks uncertainly at the leg. Oh, take it, I say, putting the drumstick in her hands. It will only keep a few days anyway, and weve got the whole bird plus the rabbit. Once shes got hold of it, her appetite wins out and she takes a huge mouthful. Id have thought, in District Eleven, youd have a bit more to eat than us. You know, since you grow the food, I say. Rues eyes widen. Oh, no, were not allowed to eat the crops. They arrest you or something? I ask. They whip you and make everyone else watch, says Rue. The mayors very strict about it. I can tell by her expression that its not that uncommon an occurrence. A public whippings a rare thing in District 12, although occasionally one occurs. Technically, Gale and I could be whipped on a daily basis for poaching in the woods well, technically, we could get a whole lot worse except all the officials buy our meat. Besides, our


mayor, Madges father, doesnt seem to have much taste for such events. Maybe being the least prestigious, poorest, most ridiculed district in the country has its advantages. Such as, being largely ignored by the Capitol as long as we produce our coal quotas. Do you get all the coal you want? Rue asks. No, I answer. Just what we buy and whatever we track in on our boots. They feed us a bit extra during harvest, so that people can keep going longer, says Rue. Dont you have to be in school? I ask. Not during harvest. Everyone works then, says Rue. Its interesting, hearing about her life. We have so little communication with anyone outside our district. In fact, I wonder if the Gamemakers are blocking out our conversation, because even though the information seems harmless, they dont want people in different districts to know about one another. At Rues suggestion, we lay out all our food to plan ahead. Shes seen most of mine, but I add the last couple of crackers and beef strips to the pile. Shes gathered quite a collection of roots, nuts, greens, and even some berries. I roll an unfamiliar berry in my fingers. You sure this is safe? Oh, yes, we have them back home. Ive been eating them for days, she says, popping a handful in her mouth. I tentatively bite into one, and its as good as our blackberries. Taking Rue on as an ally

seems a better choice all the time. We divide up our food supplies, so in case were separated, well both be set for a few days. Apart from the food, Rue has a small water skin, a homemade slingshot, and an extra pair of socks. She also has a sharp shard of rock she uses as a knife. I know its not much, she says as if embarrassed, but I had to get away from the Cornucopia fast. You did just right, I say. When I spread out my gear, she gasps a little when she sees the sunglasses. How did you get those? she asks. In my pack. Theyve been useless so far. They dont block the sun and they make it harder to see, I say with a shrug. These arent for sun, theyre for darkness, exclaims Rue. Sometimes, when we harvest through the night, theyll pass out a few pairs to those of us highest in the trees. Where the torchlight doesnt reach. One time, this boy Martin, he tried to keep his pair. Hid it in his pants. They killed him on the spot. They killed a boy for taking these? I say. Yes, and everyone knew he was no danger. Martin wasnt right in the head. I mean, he still acted like a three-year-old. He just wanted the glasses to play with, says Rue. Hearing this makes me feel like District 12 is some sort of safe haven. Of course, people keel over from starvation all the time, but I cant imagine the Peacekeepers murdering a simpleminded child. Theres a little

girl, one of Greasy Saes grandkids, who wanders around the Hob. Shes not quite right, but shes treated as a sort of pet. People toss her scraps and things. So what do these do? I ask Rue, taking the glasses. They let you see in complete darkness, says Rue. Try them tonight when the sun goes

down. I give Rue some matches and she makes sure I have plenty of leaves in case my stings flare up again. We extinguish our fire and head upstream until its almost nightfall. Where do you sleep? I ask her. In the trees? She nods. In just your jacket? Rue holds up her extra pair of socks. I have these for my hands. I think of how cold the nights have been. You can share my sleeping bag if you want. Well both easily fit. Her face lights up. I can tell this is more than she dared hope for. We pick a fork high in a tree and settle in for the night just as the anthem begins to play. There were no deaths today. Rue, I only woke up today. How many nights did I miss? The anthem should block out our words, but still I whisper. I even take the precaution of covering my lips with my hand. I dont want the audience to know what Im planning to tell her about Peeta. Taking a cue from me, she does the same. Two, she says. The

girls from Districts One and Four are dead. Theres ten of us left. Something strange happened. At least, I think it did. It might have been the tracker jacker venom making me imagine things, I say. You know the boy from my district? Peeta? I think he saved my life. But he was with the Careers. Hes not with them now, she says. Ive spied on their base camp by the lake. They made it back before they collapsed from the stingers. But hes not there. Maybe he did save you and had to run. I dont answer. If, in fact, Peeta did save me, Im in his debt again. And this cant be paid back. If he did, it was all probably just part of his act. You know, to make people think hes in love with me. Oh, says Rue thoughtfully. I didnt think that was an act. Course it is, I say. He worked it out with our mentor. The anthem ends and the sky goes dark. Lets try out these glasses. I pull out the glasses and slip them on. Rue wasnt kidding. I can see everything from the leaves on the trees to a skunk strolling through the bushes a good fifty feet away. I could kill it from here if I had a mind to. I could kill anyone. I wonder who else got a pair of these, I say. The Careers have two pairs. But theyve got everything down by the lake, Rue says. And theyre so strong. Were strong, too, I say. Just in a different way. You are. You can shoot, she says. What can I do? You can feed

yourself. Can they? I ask. They dont need to. They have all those supplies, Rue says. Say they didnt. Say the supplies were gone. How long would they last? I say. I mean, its the Hunger Games, right? But, Katniss, theyre not hungry, says Rue. No, theyre not. Thats the problem, I agree. And for the first time, I have a plan. A plan that isnt motivated by the need for flight and evasion. An offensive plan. I think were going to have to fix that, Rue.

16.

Rue has decided to trust me wholeheartedly. I know this because as soon as the anthem finishes she snuggles up against me and falls asleep. Nor do I have any misgivings about her, as I take no particular precautions. If shed wanted me dead, all she

would have had to do was disappear from that tree without pointing out the tracker jacker nest. Needling me, at the very back of my mind, is the obvious. Both of us cant win these Games. But since the odds are still against either of us surviving, I manage to ignore the thought. Besides, Im distracted by my latest idea about the Careers and their supplies. Somehow Rue and I must find a way to destroy their food. Im pretty sure feeding themselves will be a tremendous struggle. Traditionally, the Career tributes strategy is to get hold of all the food early on and work from there. The years when they have not protected it well one year a pack of hideous reptiles destroyed it, another a Gamemakers flood washed it away those are usually the years that tributes from other districts have won. That the Careers have been better red growing up is actually to their disadvantage, because they dont know how to be hungry. Not the way Rue and I do. But Im too exhausted to begin any detailed plan tonight. My wounds recovering, my mind still a bit foggy from the venom, and the warmth of Rue at my side, her head cradled on my shoulder, have given me a sense of security. I realize, for the first time, how very lonely Ive been in the arena. How comforting the presence of another human being can be. I give in to my drowsiness, resolving that tomorrow the tables will turn. Tomorrow, its the Careers who will have to watch their backs. The boom of the cannon jolts me awake.

The skys streaked with light, the birds already chattering. Rue perches in a branch across from me, her hands cupping something. We wait, listening for more shots, but there arent any. Who do you think that was? I cant help thinking of Peeta. I dont know. It could have been any of the others, says Rue. I guess well know tonight. Whos left again? I ask. The boy from District One. Both tributes from Two. The boy from Three. Thresh and me. And you and Peeta, says Rue. Thats eight. Wait, and the boy from Ten, the one with the bad leg. He makes nine. Theres someone else, but neither of us can remember who it is. I wonder how that last one died, says Rue. No telling. But its good for us. A death should hold the crowd for a bit. Maybe well have time to do something before the Gamemakers decide things have been moving too slowly, I say. Whats in your hands? Breakfast, says Rue. She holds them out revealing two big eggs. What kind are those? I ask. Not sure. Theres a marshy area over that way. Some kind of waterbird, she says. Itd be nice to cook them, but neither of us wants to risk a fire. My guess is the tribute who died today was a victim of the Careers, which means theyve recovered enough to be back in the Games. We each suck out the insides of an egg, eat a rabbit leg and some berries. Its a good breakfast anywhere. Ready to do it? I say, pulling on my pack. Do what? says Rue, but by the way she bounces up, you can tell shes up for whatever I propose. Today we take out the Careers food, I say. Really?

How? You can see the glint of excitement in her eyes. In this way, shes exactly the opposite of Prim for whom adventures are an ordeal. No idea. Come on, well figure out a plan while we hunt, I say. We dont get much hunting done though because Im too busy getting every scrap of information I can out of Rue about the Careers base. Shes only been in to spy on them briefly, but shes observant. They have set up their camp beside the lake. Their supply stash is about thirty yards away. During the day, theyve been leaving another tribute, the boy from District 3, to watch over the supplies. The boy from District Three? I ask. Hes working with them? Yes, he stays at the camp full-time. He got stung, too, when they drew the tracker jackers in by the lake, says Rue. I guess they agreed to let him live if he acted as their guard. But hes not very big. What weapons does he have? I ask. Not much that I could see. A spear. He might be able to hold a few of us off with that, but Thresh could kill

him easily, says Rue. And the foods just out in the open? I say. She nods. Somethings not quite right about that whole setup. I know. But I couldnt tell what exactly, says Rue. Katniss, even if you could get to the food, how would you get rid of it? Burn it. Dump it in the lake. Soak it in fuel. I poke Rue in the belly, just like I would Prim. Eat it! She giggles. Dont worry, Ill think of something. Destroying things is much easier than making them. For a while, we dig roots, we gather berries and greens, we devise a strategy in hushed voices. And I come to know Rue, the oldest of six kids, fiercely protective of her siblings, who gives her rations to the younger ones, who forages in the meadows in a district where the Peacekeepers are far less obliging than ours. Rue, who when you ask her what she loves most in the world, replies, of all things, Music. Music? I say. In our world, I rank music somewhere between hair ribbons and rainbows in terms of usefulness. At least a rainbow gives you a tip about the weather. You have a lot of time for that? We sing at home. At work, too. Thats why I love your pin, she says, pointing to the mockingjay that Ive again forgotten about. You have mockingjays? I ask. Oh, yes. I have a few that are my special friends. We can sing back and forth for hours. They carry messages for me, she says. What do you mean? I say. Im usually up highest, so Im the first to see the flag that signals quitting time. Theres a special little song I do, says Rue. She opens her mouth and sings a little four-note run in a sweet, clear voice. And the mockingjays spread it around the orchard. Thats how everyone knows to knock off, she continues. They can be dangerous though, if you get too near their nests. But you cant blame them for that. I unclasp the pin and hold it out to her. Here, you take it. It has more meaning for you than me. Oh, no, says Rue, closing my fingers back over the pin. I like to see it on you. Thats how I decided I could trust you.

Besides, I have this. She pulls a necklace woven out of some kind of grass from her shirt. On it, hangs a roughly carved wooden star. Or maybe its a flower. Its a good luck charm. Well, its worked so far, I say, pinning the mockingjay back on my shirt. Maybe you should just stick with that. By lunch, we have a plan. By early afternoon, we are poised to carry it out. I help Rue collect and place the wood for the first two campfires, the third shell have time for on her own. We decide to meet afterward at the site where we ate our first meal together. The stream should help guide me back

to it. Before I leave, I make sure Rues well stocked with food and matches. I even insist she take my sleeping bag, in case its not possible to rendezvous by nightfall. What about you? Wont you be cold? she asks. Not if I pick up another bag down by the lake, I say. You know, stealing isnt illegal here, I say with a grin. At the last minute, Rue decides to teach me her mockingjay signal, the one she gives to indicate the days work is done. It might not work. But if you hear the mockingjays singing it, youll know Im okay, only I cant get back right away. Are there many mockingjays here? I ask. Havent you seen them? Theyve got nests everywhere, she says. I have to admit I havent noticed. Okay, then. If all goes according to plan, Ill see you for dinner, I say. Unexpectedly, Rue throws her arms around me. I only hesitate a moment before I hug her back. You be careful, she says to me. You, too, I say. I turn and head back to the stream, feeling somehow worried. About Rue being killed, about Rue not being killed and the two of us being left for last, about leaving Rue alone, about leaving Prim alone back home. No, Prim has my mother and Gale and a baker who has promised she wont go hungry. Rue has only me. Once I reach the stream, I have only to follow it downhill to the place I initially picked it up after the tracker jacker attack. I have to be cautious as I move along the water though, because I find my thoughts preoccupied with unanswered questions, most of which concern Peeta. The cannon that fired early this morning, did that signify his death? If so, how did he die? At the hand of a Career? And was that in revenge for letting me live? I struggle again to remember that moment over Glimmers body, when he burst through the trees. But just the fact that he was sparkling leads me to doubt everything that happened. I must have been moving very slowly yesterday because I reach the shallow stretch where I took my bath in just a few hours. I stop to replenish my water and add a layer of mud to my backpack. It seems bent on reverting to orange no matter how many times I cover it. My proximity to the Careers camp sharpens my senses, and the closer I get to them, the more guarded I am, pausing frequently to listen for unnatural sounds, an arrow already fitted into the string of my bow. I dont see any other tributes, but I do notice some of the things Rue has mentioned.

Patches of the sweet berries. A bush with the leaves that healed my stings. Clusters of tracker jacker nests in the vicinity of the tree I was trapped in. And here

and there, the black-and-white flash of a mockingjay wing in the branches high over my head. When I reach the tree with the abandoned nest at the foot, I pause a moment, to gather my courage. Rue has given specific instructions on how to reach the best spying place near the lake from this point. Remember, I tell myself. Youre the hunter now, not them. I get a firmer grasp on my bow and go on. I make it to the copse Rue has told me about and again have to admire her cleverness. Its right at the edge of the wood, but the bushy foliage is so thick down low I can easily observe the Career camp without being spotted. Between us lies the flat expanse where the Games began. There are four tributes. The boy from District 1, Cato and the girl from District 2, and a scrawny, ashen-skinned boy who must be from District 3. He made almost no impression on me at all during our time in the Capitol. I can remember almost nothing about him, not his costume, not his training score, not his interview. Even now, as he sits there fiddling with some kind of plastic box, hes easily ignored in the presence of his large and domineering companions. But he must be of some value or they wouldnt have bothered to let him live. Still, seeing him only adds to my sense of unease over why the Careers would possibly leave him as a guard, why they have allowed him to live at all. All four tributes seem to still be recovering from the tracker jacker attack. Even from here, I can see the large swollen lumps on their bodies. They must not have had the sense to remove the stingers, or if they did, not known about the leaves that healed them. Apparently, whatever medicines they found in the Cornucopia have been ineffective. The Cornucopia sits in its original position, but its insides have been picked clean. Most of the supplies, held in crates, burlap sacks, and plastic bins, are piled neatly in a pyramid in what seems a questionable distance from the camp. Others are sprinkled around the perimeter of the pyramid, almost mimicking the layout of supplies around the Cornucopia at the onset of the Games. A canopy of netting that, aside from discouraging birds, seems to be useless shelters the pyramid itself. The whole setup is completely perplexing. The distance, the netting, and the presence of the boy from District 3. One things for sure, destroying those supplies is not going to be as simple as it looks. Some other factor is at play here, and Id better stay put until I figure out what it is. My guess is the pyramid is booby-trapped in some manner. I think of concealed pits, descending nets, a thread that when broken sends a poisonous dart into your heart. Really, the

possibilities are endless. While I am mulling over my options, I hear Cato shout out. Hes pointing up to the woods, far beyond me, and without turning I know

that Rue must have set the first campfire. Wed made sure to gather enough green wood to make the smoke noticeable. The Careers begin to arm themselves at once. An argument breaks out. Its loud enough for me to hear that it concerns whether or not the boy from District 3 should stay or accompany them. Hes coming. We need him in the woods, and his jobs done here anyway. No one can touch those supplies, says Cato. What about Lover Boy? says the boy from District 1. I keep telling you, forget about him. I know where I cut him. Its a miracle he hasnt bled to death yet. At any rate, hes in no shape to raid us, says Cato. So Peeta is out there in the woods, wounded badly. But I am still in the dark on what motivated him to betray the Careers. Come on, says Cato. He thrusts a spear into the hands of the boy from District 3, and they head off in the direction of the fire. The last thing I hear as they enter the woods is Cato saying, When we find her, I kill her in my own way, and no one interferes. Somehow I dont think hes talking about Rue. She didnt drop a nest of acker jackers on him. I stay put for a half an hour or so, trying to figure out what to do about the supplies. The one advantage I have with the bow and arrow is distance. I could send a flaming arrow into the pyramid easily enough Im a good enough shot to get it through those openings in the net but theres no guarantee it would catch. More likely itd just burn itself out and then what? Id have achieved nothing and given them far too much information about myself. That I was here, that I have an accomplice, that I can use the bow and arrow with accuracy. Theres no alternative. Im going to have to get in closer and see if I cant discover what exactly protects the supplies. In fact, Im just about to reveal myself when a movement catches my eye. Several hundred yards to my right, I see someone emerge from the woods. For a second, I think its Rue, but then I recognize Foxface shes the one we couldnt remember this morning creeping out onto the plain. When she decides its safe, she runs for the pyramid, with quick, small steps. Just before she reaches the circle of supplies that have been littered around the pyramid, she stops, searches the ground, and carefully places her feet on a spot. Then she begins to approach the pyramid with strange little hops, sometimes landing on one foot, teetering slightly,

sometimes risking a few steps. At one point, she launches up in the air, over a small barrel and lands poised on her tiptoes. But she overshot slightly, and her momentum throws her forward. I hear her give a sharp squeal as her hands hit the ground, but nothing happens. In a moment, shes regained her feet and continues until she has reached the bulk of the supplies. So, Im right about the booby trap, but its clearly more complex than I had imagined. I was right about the girl, too. How wily is she to have discovered this path into the food and to be able to replicate it so neatly? She fills her

pack, taking a few items from a variety of containers, crackers from a crate, a handful of apples from a burlap sack that hangs suspended from a rope off the side of a bin. But only a handful from each, not enough to tip off that the food is missing. Not enough to cause suspicion. And then shes doing her odd little dance back out of the circle and scampering into the woods again, safe and sound. I realize Im grinding my teeth in frustration. Foxface has confirmed what Id already guessed. But what sort of trap have they laid that requires such dexterity? Has so many trigger points? Why did she squeal so as her hands made contact with the earth? Youd have thought . . . And slowly it begins to dawn on me . . . Youd have thought the very ground was going to explode. Its mined, I whisper. That explains everything. The Careers willingness to leave their supplies, Foxfaces reaction, the involvement of the boy from District 3, where they have the factories, where they make televisions and automobiles and explosives. But where did he get them? In the supplies? Thats not the sort of weapon the Gamemakers usually provide, given that they like to see the tributes draw blood personally. I slip out of the bushes and cross to one of the round metal plates that lifted the tributes into the arena. The ground around it has been dug up and patted back down. The land mines were disabled after the sixty seconds we stood on the plates, but the boy from District 3 must have managed to reactivate them. Ive never seen anyone in the Games do that. I bet it came as a shock even to the Gamemakers. Well, hurray for the boy from District 3 for putting one over on them, but what am I supposed to do now? Obviously, I cant go strolling into that mess without blowing myself sky-high. As for sending in a burning arrow, thats more laughable than ever. The mines are set off by pressure. It doesnt have to be a lot, either. One year, a girl

dropped her token, a small wooden ball, while she was at her plate, and they literally had to scrape bits of her off the ground. My arms pretty good, I might be able to chuck some rocks in there and set off what? Maybe one mine? That could start a chain reaction. Or could it? Would the boy from District 3 have placed the mines in such a way that a single mine would not disturb the others? Thereby protecting the supplies but ensuring the death of the invader. Even if I only blew up one mine, Id draw the Careers back down on me for sure. And anyway, what am I thinking? Theres that net, clearly strung to deflect any such attack. Besides, what Id really need is to throw about thirty rocks in there at once, setting off a big chain reaction, demolishing the whole lot. I glance back up at the woods. The smoke from Rues second fire is wafting toward the sky. By now, the Careers have probably begun to suspect some sort of trick. Time is running out. There is a solution to this, I know there is, if I can only focus hard enough. I stare at the pyramid, the

bins, the crates, too heavy to topple over with an arrow. Maybe one contains cooking oil, and the burning arrow idea is reviving when I realize I could end uplosing all twelve of my arrows and not get a direct hit on an oil bin, since Id just be guessing. Im genuinely thinking of trying to re-create Foxfaces trip up to the pyramid in hopes of finding a new means of destruction when my eyes light on the burlap bag of apples. I could sever the rope in one shot, didnt I do as much in the Training Center? Its a big bag, but it still might only be good for one explosion. If only I could free the apples themselves . . . I know what to do. I move into range and give myself three arrows to get the job done. I place my feet carefully, block out the rest of the world as I take meticulous aim, The first arrow tears through the side of the bag near the top, leaving a split in the burlap. The second widens it to a gaping hole. I can see the first apple teetering when I let the third arrow go, catching the torn flap of burlap and ripping it from the bag. For a moment, everything seems frozen in time. Then the apples spill to the ground and Im blown backward into the air.

17.

The impact with the hard-packed earth of the plain knocks the wind out of me.

My backpack does little to soften the blow. Fortunately my quiver has caught in the crook of my elbow, sparing both itself and my shoulder, and my bow is locked in my grasp. The ground still shakes with explosions. I cant hear them. I cant hear anything at the moment. But the apples must have set off enough mines, causing debris to activate the others. I manage to shield my face with my arms as shattered bits of matter, some of it burning, rain down around me. An acrid smoke fills the air, which is not the best remedy for someone trying to regain the ability to breathe. After about a minute, the ground stops vibrating. I roll on my side and allow myself a moment of satisfaction the sight of the smoldering wreckage that was recently the pyramid. The Careers arent likely to salvage anything out of that. Id better get out of here, I think. Theyll be making a beeline for the place. But once Im on my feet, I realize escape may not be so simple. Im dizzy. Not the slightly wobbly kind, but the kind that sends the trees swooping around you and causes the earth to move in waves under your feet. I take a few steps and somehow wind up on my hands and knees. I wait a few minutes to let it pass, but it doesnt. Panic begins to set in. I cant stay here. Flight is essential. But I can neither walk nor hear. I place a hand to my left ear, the

one that was turned toward the blast, and it comes away bloody. Have I gone deaf from the explosion? The idea frightens me. I rely as much on my ears as my eyes as a hunter, maybe more at times. But I cant let my fear show. Absolutely, positively, I am live on every screen in Panem. No blood trails, I tell myself, and manage to pull my hood up over my head, tie the cord under my chin with uncooperative

fingers. That should help soak up the blood. I cant walk, but can I crawl? I move forward tentatively. Yes, if I go very slowly, I can crawl. Most of the woods will offer insufficient cover. My only hope is to make it back to Rues copse and conceal myself in greenery. I cant get caught out here on my hands and knees in the open. Not only will I face death, its sure to be a long and painful one at Catos hand. The thought of Prim having to watch that keeps me doggedly inching my way toward the hideout. Another blast knocks me flat on my face. A stray mine, set off by some collapsing crate. This happens twice more. Im reminded of those last few kernels that burst when Prim and I pop corn over the fire at home. To say I make it in the nick of time is an understatement. I have literally just dragged myself into the tangle of hushes at

the base of the trees when theres Cato, barreling onto the plain, soon followed by his companions. His rage is so extreme it might be comical so people really do tear out their hair and beat the ground with their fists if I didnt know that it was aimed at me, at what I have done to him. Add to that my proximity, my inability to run or defend myself, and in fact, the whole thing has me terrified. Im glad my hiding place makes it impossible for the cameras to get a close shot of me because Im biting my nails like theres no tomorrow. Gnawing off the last bits of nail polish, trying to keep my teeth from chattering. The boy from District 3 throws stones into the ruins and must have declared all the mines activated because the Careers are approaching the wreckage. Cato has finished the first phase of his tantrum and takes out his anger on the smoking remains by kicking open various containers. The other tributes are poking around in the mess, looking for anything to salvage, but theres nothing. The boy from District 3 has done his job too well. This idea must occur to Cato, too, because he turns on the boy and appears to be shouting at him. The boy from District 3 only has time to turn and run before Cato catches him in a headlock from behind. I can see the muscles ripple in Catos arms as he sharply jerks the boys head to the side.

Its that quick. The death of the boy from District 3. The other two Careers seem to be trying to calm Cato down. I can tell he wants to return to the woods, but they keep pointing at the sky, which puzzles me until I realize, Of course. They think whoever set off the explosions is dead. They dont know about the arrows and the apples. They assume the booby trap was faulty, but that the tribute who blew up the supplies was killed doing it. If there was a cannon shot, it could have been easily lost in the subsequent explosions. The shattered remains of the thief removed by hovercraft. They retire to the far side of the lake to allow the Gamemakers to retrieve the body of the boy from District 3. And they wait. I suppose a cannon goes off. A hovercraft appears and takes the dead boy. The sun dips below

the horizon. Night falls. Up in the sky, I see the seal and know the anthem must have begun. A moment of darkness. They show the boy from District 3. They show the boy from District 10, who must have died this morning. Then the seal reappears. So, now they know. The bomber survived. In the seals light, I can see Cato and the girl from District 2 put on their night-vision glasses. The boy from District 1 ignites a

tree branch for a torch, illuminating the grim determination on all their faces. The Careers stride back into the woods to hunt. The dizziness has subsided and while my left ear is still deafened, I can hear a ringing in my right, which seems a good sign. Theres no point in leaving my hiding place, though. Im about as safe as I can be, here at the crime scene. They probably think the bomber has a two- or three-hour lead on them. Still its a long time before I risk moving. The first thing I do is dig out my own glasses and put them on, which relaxes me a little, to have at least one of my hunters senses working. I drink some water and wash the blood from my ear. Fearing the smell of meat will draw unwanted predators fresh blood is bad enough I make a good meal out of the greens and roots and berries Rue and I gathered today. Where is my little ally? Did she make it back to the rendezvous point? Is she worried about me? At least, the sky has shown were both alive. I run through the surviving tributes on my fingers. The boy from 1, both from 2, Foxface, both from 11 and 12. Just eight of us. The betting must be getting really hot in the Capitol. Theyll be doing special features on each of us now. Probably interviewing our friends and families. Its been a long time since a tribute from District 12 made it into the top eight. And now there are two

of us. Although from what Cato said, Peetas on his way out. Not that Cato is the final word on anything. Didnt he just lose his entire stash of supplies? Let the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games begin, Cato, I think. Let them begin for real. A cold breeze has sprung up. I reach for my sleeping bag before I remember I left it with Rue. I was supposed to pick up another one, but what with the mines and all, I forgot. I begin to shiver. Since roosting overnight in a tree isnt sensible anyway, I scoop out a hollow under the bushes and cover myself with leaves and pine needles. Im still freezing. I lay my sheet of plastic over my upper body and position my backpack to block the wind. Its a little better. I begin to have more sympathy for the girl from District 8 that lit the fire that first night. But now its me who needs to grit my teeth and tough it out until morning. More leaves, more pine needles. I pull my arms inside my jacket and tuck my knees up to my chest. Somehow, I drift off to sleep. When I open my eyes, the world looks slightly fractured, and it takes a minute to realize that the sun must be well up and the glasses fragmenting my vision. As I sit up and remove them, I hear a laugh somewhere near


the lake and freeze. The laughs distorted, but the fact that it registered at all means I must be regaining my hearing. Yes, my right ear can hear again, although its still ringing. As for my left ear, well, at least the bleeding has stopped. I peer through the bushes, afraid the Careers have returned, trapping me here for an indefinite time. No, its Foxface, standing in the rubble of the pyramid and laughing. Shes smarter than the Careers, actually finding a few useful items in the ashes. A metal pot. A knife blade. Im perplexed by her amusement until I realize that with the Careers stores eliminated, she might actually stand a chance. Just like the rest of us. It crosses my mind to reveal myself and enlist her as a second ally against that pack. But I rule it out. Theres something about that sly grin that makes me sure that befriending Foxface would ultimately get me a knife in the back. With that in mind, this might be an excellent time to shoot her. But shes heard something, not me, because her head turns away, toward the drop-off, and she sprints for the woods. I wait. No one, nothing shows up. Still, if Foxface thought it was dangerous, maybe its time for me to get out of here, too. Besides, Im eager to tell Rue about the pyramid. Since Ive no idea where the Careers are, the route back by the stream seems as good as any. I

hurry, loaded bow in one hand, a hunk of cold groosling in the other, because Im famished now, and not just for leaves and berries but for the fat and protein in the meat. The trip to the stream is uneventful. Once there, I refill my water and wash, taking particular care with my injured ear. Then I travel uphill using the stream as a guide. At one point, I find boot prints in the mud along the bank. The Careers have been here, but not for a while. The prints are deep because they were made in soft mud, but now theyre nearly dry in the hot sun. I havent been careful enough about my own tracks, counting on a light tread and the pine needles to conceal my prints. Now I strip off my boots and socks and go barefoot up the bed of the stream. The cool water has an invigorating effect on my body, my spirits. I shoot two fish, easy pickings in this slow-moving stream, and go ahead and eat one raw even though Ive just had the groosling. The second Ill save for Rue. Gradually, subtly, the ringing in my right ear diminishes until its gone entirely. I find myself pawing at my left ear periodically, trying to clean away whatever deadens its ability to collect sounds. If theres improvement, its undetectable. I cant adjust to deafness in the ear. It makes me feel off-balanced and defenseless to my left. Blind even. My head keeps turning to

the injured side, as my right ear tries to compensate for the wall of nothingness where yesterday there was a constant flow of information. The more time that passes, the less hopeful I am that this is an injury that will heal. When I reach the site of our first meeting, I feel certain its been

undisturbed. Theres no sign of Rue, not on the ground or in the trees. This is odd. By now she should have returned, as its midday. Undoubtedly, she spent the night in a tree somewhere. What else could she do with no light and the Careers with their night-vision glasses tramping around the woods. And the third fire she was supposed to set although I forgot to check for it last night was the farthest from our site of all. Shes probably just being cautious about making her way back. I wish shed hurry, because I dont want to hang around here too long. I want to spend the afternoon traveling to higher ground, hunting as we go. But theres nothing really for me to do but wait. I wash the blood out of my jacket and hair and clean my ever-growing list of wounds. The burns are much better but I use a bit of medicine on them anyway. The main thing to worry about now is keeping out infection. I go ahead andeat the second fish. It isnt going to last long in this hot sun, but it should be easy enough to spear a few more for Rue. If she would just show up. Feeling too vulnerable on the ground with my lopsided hearing, I scale a tree to wait. If the Careers show up, this will be a fine place to shoot them from. The sun moves slowly. I do things to pass the time. Chew leaves and apply them to my stings that are deflated but still tender. Comb through my damp hair with my fingers and braid it. Lace my boots back up. Check over my bow and remaining nine arrows. Test my left ear repeatedly for signs of life by rustling a leaf near it, but without good results. Despite the groosling and the fish, my stomachs growling, and I know Im going to have what we call a hollow day back in District 12. Thats a day where no matter what you put in your belly, its never enough. Having nothing to do but sit in a tree makes it worse, so I decide to give into it. After all, Ive lost a lot of weight in the arena, I need some extra calories. And having the bow and arrows makes me far more confident about my future prospects. I slowly peel and eat a handful of nuts. My last cracker. The groosling neck. Thats good because it takes time to pick clean. Finally, a groosling wing and the bird is history. But its a hollow day, and even with all that I start daydreaming about food.

Particularly the decadent dishes served in the Capitol. The chicken in creamy orange sauce. The cakes and pudding. Bread with butter. Noodles in green sauce. The lamb and dried plum stew. I suck on a few mint leaves and tell myself to get over it. Mint is good because we drink mint tea after supper often, so it tricks my stomach into thinking eating time is over. Sort of. Dangling up in the tree, with the sun warming me, a mouthful of mint, my bow and arrows at hand . . . This is the most relaxed Ive been since Ive entered the arena. If only Rue would show up, and we could clear out. As the shadows grow, so does my restlessness. By late afternoon, Ive resolved to go looking for her. I can at least visit the spot

where she set the third fire and see if there are any clues to her whereabouts. Before I go, I scatter a few mint leaves around our old campfire. Since we gathered these some distance away, Rue will understand Ive been here, while theyll mean nothing to the Careers. In less than an hour, Im at the place where we agreed to have the third fire and I know something has gone amiss. The wood has been neatly arranged, expertly interspersed with tinder, but it has never been lit. Rue set up thefire but never made it back here. Somewhere between the second column of smoke I spied before I blew up the supplies and this point, she ran into trouble. I have to remind myself shes still alive. Or is she? Could the cannon shot announcing her death have come in the wee hours of the morning when even my good ear was too broken to pick it up? Will she appear in the sky tonight? No, I refuse to believe it. There could be a hundred other explanations. She could have lost her way. Run into a pack of predators or another tribute, like Thresh, and had to hide. Whatever happened, Im almost certain shes stuck out there, somewhere between the second fire and the unlit one at my feet. Something is keeping her up a tree. I think Ill go hunt it down. Its a relief to be doing something after sitting around all afternoon. I creep silently through the shadows, letting them conceal me. But nothing seems suspicious. Theres no sign of any kind of struggle, no disruption of the needles on the ground. Ive stopped for just a moment when I hear it. I have to cock my head around to the side to be sure, but there it is again. Rues four-note tune coming out of a mockingjays mouth. The one that means shes all right. I grin and move in the direction of the bird. Another just a short distance ahead, picks up on the handful of notes. Rue has been

singing to them, and recently. Otherwise theyd have taken up some other song. My eyes lift up into the trees, searching for a sign of her. I swallow and sing softly back, hoping shell know its safe to join me. A mockingjay repeats the melody to me. And thats when I hear the scream. Its a childs scream, a young girls scream, theres no one in the arena capable of making that sound except Rue. And now Im running, knowing this may be a trap, knowing the three Careers may be poised to attack me, but I cant help myself. Theres another high-pitched cry, this time my name. Katniss! Katniss! Rue! I shout back, so she knows Im near. So, they know Im near, and hopefully the girl who has attacked them with tracker jackers and gotten an eleven they still cant explain will be enough to pull their attention away from her. Rue! Im coming! When I break into the clearing, shes on the ground, hopelessly entangled in a net. She just has time to reach her hand through the mesh and say my name before the spear enters her body.

18.

The boy from District 1 dies before he can pull out the spear. My arrow drives deeply into the center of his neck. He falls to his knees and

halves the brief remainder of his life by yanking out the arrow and drowning in his own blood. Im reloaded, shifting my aim from side to side, while I shout at Rue, Are there more? Are there more? She has to say no several times before I hear it. Rue has rolled to her side, her body curved in and around the spear. I shove the boy away from her and pull out my knife, freeing her from the net. One look at the wound and I know its far beyond my capacity to heal, beyond anyones probably. The spearhead is buried up to the shaft in her stomach. I crouch before her, staring helplessly at the embedded weapon. Theres no point in comforting words, in telling her shell be all right. Shes no fool. Her hand reaches out and I clutch it like a lifeline. As if its me whos dying instead of Rue. You blew up the food? she whispers. Every last bit, I say. You have to win, she says. Im going to. Going to win for both of us now, I promise. I hear a cannon and look up. It must be for the boy from District 1. Dont go. Rue tightens her grip on my hand. Course not. Staying right here, I say. I move in closer

to her, pulling her head onto my lap. I gently brush the dark, thick hair back behind her ear. Sing, she says, but I barely catch the word. Sing? I think. Sing what? I do know a few songs. Believe it or not, there was once music in my house, too. Music I helped make. My father pulled me in with that remarkable voice but I havent sung much since he died. Except when Prim is very sick. Then I sing her the same songs she liked as a baby. Sing. My throat is tight with tears, hoarse from smoke and fatigue. But if this is Prims, I mean, Rues last request, I have to at least try. The song that comes to me is a simple lullaby, one we sing fretful, hungry babies to sleep with, Its old, very old I think. Made up long ago in our hills. What my music teacher calls a mountain air. But the words are easy and soothing, promising tomorrow will be more hopeful than this awful piece of time we call today. I give a small cough, swallow hard, and begin:

Deep in the meadow, under the willowA bed of grass, a soft green pillowLay down your head, and close your sleepy eyesAnd when again they open, the sun will rise.Here its safe, here its warmHere the daisies guard you from every harmHere your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them trueHere is the place where I love you.

Rues eyes have fluttered shut. Her chest moves but only slightly. My throat releases the tears and they slide down my cheeks. But I have to finish the song for her.

Deep in the meadow, hidden far awayA cloak of leaves, a moonbeam rayForget your woes and let your troubles layAnd when again its morning, theyll wash away.

Here its safe, here its warmHere the daisies guard you from every harm

The final lines are barely audible.

Here your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them trueHere is the place where I love you.

Everythings still and quiet. Then, almost eerily, the mockingjays take up my song. For a moment, I sit there, watching my tears drip down on her face. Rues cannon fires. I lean forward and press my lips against her temple. Slowly, as if not to wake her, I lay her head back on the ground and release her hand. Theyll want me to clear out now. So they can collect the bodies. And theres nothing to stay for. I roll the boy from District 1 onto his face and take his pack, retrieve the arrow that ended his life. I cut Rues pack from her back as well, knowing shed want me to have it but leave the spear in her stomach. Weapons in bodies will be transported to the hovercraft. Ive no use for a spear, so the sooner its gone from the arena the better. I cant stop looking at Rue, smaller than ever, a baby animal curled up in a nest of netting. I cant bring myself to leave her like this. Past harm, but seeming utterly defenseless. To hate the boy from District 1, who also appears so vulnerable in death, seems inadequate. Its the Capitol I hate, for doing this to all of us. Gales voice is in my head. His ravings against the Capitol no longer pointless, no longer to be ignored. Rues death has forced me to confront my own fury against the cruelty, the injustice they inflict upon us. But here, even more strongly than at home, I feel my impotence.

Theres no way to take revenge on the Capitol. Is there? Then I remember Peetas words on the roof. Only I keep wishing I could think of a way to . . . To show the Capital they dont own me. That Im more than just a piece in their Games. And for the first time, I understand what he means. I want to do something, right here, right now, to shame them, to make them accountable, to show the Capitol that whatever they do or force us to do there is a part of every tribute they cant own. That Rue was more than a piece in their Games. And so am I. A few steps into the woods grows a bank of wildflowers. Perhaps they are really weeds of some sort, but they have blossoms in beautiful shades of violet and yellow and white. I gather up an armful and come back to Rues side. Slowly, one stem at a time, I decorate her body in the flowers. Covering the ugly wound. Wreathing her face. Weaving her hair with bright colors. Theyll have to show it. Or, even if they choose to turn the cameras elsewhere at this moment, theyll have to bring them back when they collect the bodies and everyone will see her then and know I did it. I step back and take a last look at Rue. She could really be asleep in that meadow after all. Bye, Rue, I whisper. I press the three middle fingers of my left hand against my lips and hold them out in her

direction. Then I walk away without looking back. The birds fall silent. Somewhere, a mockingjay gives the warning whistle that precedes the hovercraft. I dont know how it knows. It must hear

things that humans cant. I pause, my eyes focused on whats ahead, not whats happening behind me. It doesnt take long, then the general birdsong begins again and I know shes gone. Another mockingjay, a young one by the look of it, lands on a branch before me and bursts out Rues melody. My song, the hovercraft, were too unfamiliar for this novice to pick up, but it has mastered her handful of notes. The ones that mean shes safe. Good and safe, I say as I pass under its branch. We dont have to worry about her now. Good and safe. Ive no idea where to go. The brief sense of home I had that one night with Rue has vanished. My feet wander this way and that until sunset. Im not afraid, not even watchful. Which makes me an easy target. Except Id kill anyone I met on sight. Without emotion or the slightest tremor in my hands. My hatred of the Capitol has not lessened my hatred of my competitors in the least. Especially the Careers. They, at least, can be made to pay for Rues death. No one materializes though. There arent many of us left and its a big arena. Soon theyll be pulling out some other device to force us together. But theres been enough gore today. Perhaps well even get to sleep. Im about to haul my packs into a tree to make camp when a silver parachute floats down and lands in front of me. A gift from a sponsor. But why now? Ive been in fairly good shape with supplies. Maybe Haymitchs noticed my despondency and is trying to cheer me up a bit. Or could it be something to help my ear? I open the parachute and find a small loaf of bread Its not the fine white Capitol stuff. Its made of dark ration grain and shaped in a crescent. Sprinkled with seeds. I flash back to Peetas lesson on the various district breads in the Training Center. This bread came from District 11. I cautiously lift the still warm loaf. What must it have cost the people of District 11 who cant even feed themselves? How many wouldve had to do without to scrape up a coin to put in the collection for this one loaf? It had been meant for Rue, surely. But instead of pulling the gift when she died, theyd authorized Haymitch to give it to me. As a thank-you? Or because, like me, they dont like to let debts go unpaid? For whatever reason, this is a first. A district gift to a tribute whos not your own. I lift my face and step into the last falling rays of

sunlight. My thanks to the people of District Eleven, I say. I want them to know I know where it came from. That the full value of their gift has been recognized. I climb dangerously high into a tree, not for safety but to get as far away from today as I can. My sleeping bag is rolled neatly in Rues pack. Tomorrow Ill sort through the supplies. Tomorrow Ill make a new plan. But tonight, all I can do is strap myself in and take tiny bites of the bread. Its good. It tastes of home. Soon the seals in the sky, the anthem plays in my right ear. I see the boy from District 1, Rue. Thats all for tonight. Six of us left, I think. Only six. With

the bread still locked in my hands, I fall asleep at once. Sometimes when things are particularly bad, my brain will give me a happy dream. A visit with my father in the woods. An hour of sunlight and cake with Prim. Tonight it sends me Rue, still decked in her flowers, perched in a high sea of trees, trying to teach me to talk to the mockingjays. I see no sign of her wounds, no blood, just a bright, laughing girl. She sings songs Ive never heard in a clear, melodic voice. On and on. Through the night. Theres a drowsy in-between period when I can hear the last few strains of her music although shes lost in the leaves. When I fully awaken, Im momentarily comforted. I try to hold on to the peaceful feeling of the dream, but it quickly slips away, leaving me sadder and lonelier than ever. Heaviness infuses my whole body, as if theres liquid lead in my veins. Ive lost the will to do the simplest tasks, to do anything but lie here, staring unblinkingly through the canopy of leaves. For several hours, I remain motionless. As usual, its the thought of Prims anxious face as she watches me on the screens back home that breaks me from my lethargy. I give myself a series of simple commands to follow, like Now you have to sit up, Katniss. Now you have to drink water, Katniss. I act on the orders with slow, robotic motions. Now you have to sort the packs, Katniss. Rues pack holds my sleeping bag, her nearly empty water skin, a handful of nuts and roots, a bit of rabbit, her extra socks, and her slingshot. The boy from District 1 has several knives, two spare spearheads, a flashlight, a small leather pouch, a first-aid kit, a full bottle of water, and a pack of dried fruit. A pack of dried fruit! Out of all he might have chosen from. To me, this is a sign of extreme arrogance. Why bother to carry food when you have such a bounty back at camp? When you will kill your enemies so quickly youll be home before youre

hungry? I can only hope the other Careers traveled so lightly when it came to food and now find themselves with nothing. Speaking of which, my own supply is running low. I finish off the loaf from District 11 and the last of the rabbit. How quickly the food disappears. All I have left are Rues roots and nuts, the boys dried fruit, and one strip of beef. Now you have to hunt, Katniss, I tell myself. I obediently consolidate the supplies I want into my pack. After I climb down the tree, I conceal the boys knives and spearheads in a pile of rocks so that no one else can use them. Ive lost my bearings what with all the wandering around I did yesterday evening, but I try and head back in the general direction of the stream. I know Im on course when I come across Rues third, unlit fire. Shortly thereafter, I discover a flock of grooslings perched in the trees and take out three before they know what hit them. I return to Rues signal fire and start it up, not caring about the excessive smoke. Where are you, Cato? I think as I roast the birds and Rues roots. Im

waiting right here. Who knows where the Careers are now? Either too far to reach me or too sure this is a trick or ... Is it possible? Too scared of me? They know I have the bow and arrows, of course, Cato saw me take them from Glimmers body, but have they put two and two together yet? Figured out I blew up the supplies and killed their fellow Career? Possibly they think Thresh did this. Wouldnt he be more likely to revenge Rues death than I would? Being from the same district? Not that he ever took any interest in her. And what about Foxface? Did she hang around to watch me blow up the supplies? No. When I caught her laughing in the ashes the next morning, it was as if someone had given her a lovely surprise. I doubt they think Peeta has lit this signal fire. Catos sure hes as good as dead. I find myself wishing I could tell Peeta about the flowers I put on Rue. That I now understand what he was trying to say on the roof. Perhaps if he wins the Games, hell see me on victors night, when they replay the highlights of the Games on a screen over the stage where we did our interviews. The winner sits in a place of honor on the platform, surrounded by their support crew. But I told Rue Id be there. For both of us. And somehow that seems even more important than the vow I gave Prim. I really think I stand a chance of doing it now.


Winning. Its not just having the arrows or outsmarting the Careers a few times, although those things help. Something happened when I was holding Rues hand, watching the life drain out of her. Now I am determined to revenge her, to make her loss unforgettable, and I can only do that by winning and thereby making myself unforgettable. I overcook the birds hoping someone will show up to shoot, but no one does. Maybe the other tributes are out there beating one another senseless. Which would be fine, Ever since the bloodbath, Ive been featured on screens most than I care. Eventually, I wrap up my food and go back to the stream to replenish my water and gather some. But the heaviness from the morning drapes back over me and even though its only early evening, I climb a tree and settle in for the night. My brain begins to replay the events from yesterday. I keep seeing Rue speared, my arrow piercing the boys neck. I dont know why I should even care about the boy. Then I realize . . . He was my first kill. Along with other statistics they report to help people place their bets, every tribute has a list of kills. I guess technically Id get credited for Glimmer and the girl from District 4, too, for dumping that nest on them. But the boy from District 1 was the first person I knew would die because of my actions.Numerous animals have lost their lives at my hands, but only one human. I hear Gale saying, How different can it be, really? Amazingly similar in the execution. A bow pulled, an arrow shot. Entirely different in the aftermath. I killed a boy whose name I dont even know. Somewhere his family is weeping for him. His friends

call for my blood. Maybe he had a girlfriend who really believed he would come back . . . But then I think of Rues still body and Im able to banish the boy from my mind. At least, for now. Its been an uneventful day according to the sky. No deaths. I wonder how long well get until the next catastrophe drives us back together. If its going to be tonight, I want to get some sleep first. I cover my good ear to block out the strains of the anthem, but then I hear the trumpets and sit straight up in anticipation. For the most part, the only communication the tributes get from outside the arena is the nightly death toll. But occasionally, there will be trumpets followed by an announcement. Usually, this will be a call to a feast. When food is scarce, the Gamemakers will invite the players to a banquet, somewhere known to all like the Cornucopia, as an inducement to gather and fight. Sometimes there is a feast

and sometimes theres nothing but a loaf of stale bread for the tributes to compete for. I wouldnt go in for the food, but this could be an ideal time to take out a few competitors. Claudius Templesmiths voice booms down from overhead, congratulating the six of us who remain. But he is not inviting us to a feast. Hes saying something very confusing. Theres been a rule change in the Games. A rule change! That in itself is mind bending since we dont really have any rules to speak of except dont step off your circle for sixty seconds and the unspoken rule about not eating one another. Under the new rule, both tributes from the same district will be declared winners if they are the last two alive. Claudius pauses, as if he knows were not getting it, and repeats the change again. The news sinks in. Two tributes can win this year. If theyre from the same district. Both can live. Both of us can live. Before I can stop myself, I call out Peetas name.

PART III"THE VICTOR"

19.I clap my hands over my mouth, but the sound has already escaped. The sky goes black and I hear a chorus of frogs begin to sing. Stupid! I tell myself. What a stupid thing to do! I wait, frozen, for the woods to come alive with assailants. Then I remember theres almost no one left. Peeta, whos been wounded, is now my ally. Whatever doubts Ive had about him dissipate because if either of us took the others life now wed be pariahs when we returned to District 12. In fact, I know if I was watching Id loathe any tribute who didnt immediately ally with their district partner. Besides, it just makes sense to protect each other. And in my case being one of the star-crossed lovers from District 12 its an absolute requirement if I want any more help from sympathetic sponsors. The star-crossed lovers . . . Peeta must have been playing that angle all along. Why else would the Gamemakers have made this unprecedented change in the rules? For two tributes to have a shot at winning, our romance must be so popular with the audience that condemning it would jeopardize the success of the Games. No

thanks to me. All Ive done is managed not to kill Peeta. But whatever hes done

in the arena, he must have the audience convinced it was to keep me alive. Shaking his head to keep me from running to the Cornucopia. Fighting Cato to let me escape. Even hooking up with the Careers must have been a move to protect me. Peeta, it turns out, has never been a danger to me. The thought makes me smile. I drop my hands and hold my face up to the moonlight so the cameras can be sure to catch it. So, who is there left to be afraid of? Foxface? The boy tribute from her district is dead. Shes operating alone, at night. And her strategy has been to evade, not attack. I dont really think that, even if she heard my voice, shed do anything but hope someone else would kill me. Then theres Thresh. All right, hes a distinct threat. But I havent seen him, not once, since the Games began. I think about how Foxface grew alarmed when she heard a sound at the site of the explosion. But she didnt turn to the Woods, she turned to whatever lies across from it. To that area of the arena that drops off into I dont know what. I feel almost certain that the person she ran from was Thresh and that is his domain. Hed never have heard me from there and, even if he did, Im up too high for someone his size to reach. So that leaves Cato and the girl from District 2, who are now surely celebrating the new rule. Theyre the only

ones left who benefit from it besides Peeta and myself. Do I run from them now, on the chance they heard me call Peetas name? No, I think. Let them come. Let them come with their night-vision glasses and their heavy, branch-breaking bodies. Right into the range of my arrows. But I know they wont. If they didnt come in daylight to my fire, they wont risk what could be another trap at night. When they come, it will be on their own terms, not because Ive let them know my whereabouts. Stay put and get some sleep, Katniss, I instruct myself, although I wish I could start tracking Peeta now. Tomorrow, youll find him. I do sleep, but in the morning Im extra-cautious, thinking that while the Careers might hesitate to attack me in a tree, theyre completely capable of setting an ambush for me. I make sure to fully prepare myself for the day eating a big breakfast, securing my pack, readying my weapons before I descend. But all seems peaceful and undisturbed on the ground. Today Ill have to be scrupulously careful. The Careers will know Im trying to locate Peeta. They may well want to wait until I do before they move in. If hes as badly wounded as Cato thinks, Id be in the position of having to defend us both without any assistance. But if hes that incapacitated, how has he managed to stay alive? And how on earth will I find him? I

try to think of anything Peeta ever said that might give me an indication as to where hes hiding out, but nothing rings a bell. So I go back to the last moment I saw him sparkling in the sunlight, yelling at me to run. Then Cato appeared, his

sword drawn. And after I was gone, he wounded Peeta. But how did Peeta get away? Maybe hed held out better against the tracker jacker poison than Cato. Maybe that was the variable that allowed him to escape. But hed been stung, too. So how far could he have gotten, stabbed and filled with venom? And how has he stayed alive all these days since? If the wound and the stingers havent killed him, surely thirst would have taken him by now. And thats when I get my first clue to his whereabouts. He couldnt have survived without water. I know that from my first few days here. He must be hidden somewhere near a source. Theres the lake, but I find that an unlikely option since its so close to the Careers base camp. A few spring-fed pools. But youd really be a sitting duck at one of those. And the stream. The one that leads from the camp Rue and I made all the way down near the lake and beyond. If he stuck to the stream, he could change his location and always be near water. He could walk in the

current and erase any tracks. He might even be able to get a fish or two. Well, its a place to start, anyway. To confuse my enemies minds, I start a fire with plenty of green wood. Even if they think its a ruse, I hope theyll decide Im hidden somewhere near it. While in reality, Ill be tracking Peeta. The sun burns off the morning haze almost immediately and I can tell the day will be hotter than usual. The waters cool and pleasant on my bare feet as I head downstream. Im tempted to call out Peetas name as I go but decide against it. I will have to find him with my eyes and one good ear or he will have to find me. But hell know Ill be looking, right? He wont have so low of an opinion of me as to think Id ignore the new rule and keep to myself. Would he? Hes very hard to predict, which might be interesting under different circumstances, but at the moment only provides an extra obstacle. It doesnt take long to reach the spot where I peeled off to go the Careers camp. Theres been no sign of Peeta, but this doesnt surprise me. Ive been up and down this stretch three times since the tracker jacker incident. If he were nearby, surely Id have had some suspicion of it. The stream begins to curve to the left into a part of the woods thats new to me. Muddy banks covered in tangled water plants lead to large rocks that increase in size until I

begin to feel somewhat trapped. It would be no small matter to escape the stream now. Fighting off Cato or Thresh as I climbed over this rocky terrain. In fact, Ive just about decided Im on the wrong track entirely, that a wounded boy would be unable to navigate getting to and from this water source, when I see the bloody streak going down the curve of a boulder. Its long dried now, but the smeary lines running side to side suggest someone who perhaps was not fully in control of his mental faculties tried to wipe it away. Hugging the rocks, I move slowly in the direction of the blood, searching for him. I find a few more bloodstains, one

with a few threads of fabric glued to it, but no sign of life. I break down and say his name in a hushed voice. Peeta! Peeta! Then a mockingjay lands on a scruffy tree and begins to mimic my tones so I stop. I give up and climb back down to the stream thinking, He must have moved on. Somewhere farther down. My foot has just broken the surface of the water when I hear a voice. You here to finish me off, sweetheart? I whip around. Its come from the left, so I cant pick it up very well. And the voice was hoarse and weak. Still, it must have been Peeta. Who else in the arena would call me

sweetheart? My eyes peruse the bank, but theres nothing. Just mud, the plants, the base of the rocks. Peeta? I whisper. Where are you? Theres no answer. Could I just have imagined it? No, Im certain it was real and very close at hand, too. Peeta? I creep along the bank. Well, dont step on me. I jump back. His voice was right under my feet. Still theres nothing. Then his eyes open, unmistakably blue in the brown mud and green leaves. I gasp and am rewarded with a hint of white teeth as he laughs. Its the final word in camouflage. Forget chucking weights around. Peeta should have gone into his private session with the Gamemakers and painted himself into a tree. Or a boulder. Or a muddy bank full of weeds. Close your eyes again, I order. He does, and his mouth, too, and completely disappears. Most of what I judge to be his body is actually under a layer of mud and plants. His face and arms are so artfully disguised as to be invisible. I kneel beside him. I guess all those hours decorating cakes paid off. Peeta smiles. Yes, frosting. The final defense of the dying. Youre not going to die, I tell him firmly. Says who? His voice is so ragged. Says me. Were on the same team now, you know, I tell him. His eyes open. So, I heard. Nice of you to find whats left of me. I pull out my water bottle and give him a drink. Did Cato cut you? I ask. Left leg.

Up high, he answers. Lets get you in the stream, wash you off so I can see what kind of wounds youve got, I say. Lean down a minute first, he says. Need to tell you something. I lean over and put my good ear to his lips, which tickle as he whispers. Remember, were madly in love, so its all right to kiss me anytime you feel like it. I jerk my head back but end up laughing. Thanks, Ill keep it in mind. At least, hes still able to joke around. But when I start to help him to the stream, all the levity disappears. Its only two feet away, how hard can it be? Very hard when I realize hes unable to move an inch on his own. Hes so weak that the best he can do is not to resist. I try to drag him, but despite the fact that I know hes doing all he can to keep quiet, sharp cries of pain escape him. The mud and plants seem to have imprisoned him and I finally have to give a gigantic tug to break him from their clutches. Hes still two feet from the water, lying there, teeth gritted, tears cutting trails in the dirt on his face. Look, Peeta, Im

going to roll you into the stream. Its very shallow here, okay? I say. Excellent, he says. I crouch down beside him. No matter what happens, I tell myself, dont stop

until hes in the water. On three, I say. One, two, three! I can only manage one full roll before I have to stop because of the horrible sound hes making. Now hes on the edge of the stream. Maybe this is better anyway. Okay, change of plans. Im not going to put you all the way in, I tell him. Besides, if I get him in, who knows if Id ever be able to get him out? No more rolling? he asks. Thats all done. Lets get you cleaned up. Keep an eye on the woods for me, okay? I say. Its hard to know where to start. He so caked with mud and matted leaves, I cant even see his clothes. If hes wearing clothes. The thought makes me hesitate a moment, but then I plunge in. Naked bodies are no big deal in the arena, right? Ive got two water bottles and Rues water skin. I prop them against rocks in the stream so that two are always filling while I pour the third over Peetas body. It takes a while, but I finally get rid of enough mud to find his clothes. I gently unzip his jacket, unbutton his shirt and ease them off him. His undershirt is so plastered into his wounds I have to cut it away with my knife and drench him again to work it loose. Hes badly bruised with a long burn across his chest and four tracker jacker stings, if you count the one under his ear. But I feel a bit better. This much I can fix. I decide to take care of his upper body first, to alleviate

some pain, before I tackle whatever damage Cato did to his leg. Since treating his wounds seems pointless when hes lying in whats become a mud puddle, I manage to prop him up against a boulder. He sits there, uncomplaining, while I wash away all the traces of dirt from his hair and skin. His flesh is very pale in the sunlight and he no longer looks strong and stocky. I have to dig the stingers out of his tracker jacker lumps, which causes him to wince, but the minute I apply the leaves he sighs in relief. While he dries in the sun, I wash his filthy shirt and jacket and spread them over boulders. Then I apply the burn cream to his chest. This is when I notice how hot his skin is becoming. The layer of mud and the bottles of water have disguised the fact that hes burning with fever. I dig through the first-aid kit I got from the boy from District 1 and find pills that reduce your temperature. My mother actually breaks down and buys these on occasion when her home remedies fail. Swallow these, I tell him, and he obediently takes the medicine. You must be hungry. Not really. Its funny, I havent been hungry for days, says Peeta. In fact, when I offer him groosling, he wrinkles his nose at it and turns away. Thats when I know how sick he is. Peeta, we need to get some food in you, I insist. Itll just come right back up, he says. The best I

can do is to get him to eat a few bits of dried apple. Thanks. Im much better, really. Can I sleep now,

Katniss? he asks. Soon, I promise. I need to look at your leg first. Trying to be as gentle as I can, I remove his boots, his socks, and then very slowly inch his pants off of him. I can see the tear Catos sword made in the fabric over his thigh, but it in no way prepares me for what lies underneath. The deep inflamed gash oozing both blood and pus. The swelling of the leg. And worst of all, the smell of festering flesh. I want to run away. Disappear into the woods like I did that day they brought the burn victim to our house. Go and hunt while my mother and Prim attend to what I have neither the skill nor the courage to face. But theres no one here but me. I try to capture the calm demeanor my mother assumes when handling particularly bad cases. Pretty awful, huh? says Peeta. Hes watching me closely. So-so. I shrug like its no big deal. You should see some of the people they bring my mother from the mines. I refrain from saying how I usually clear out of the house whenever shes treating anything worse than a cold. Come to think of it, I dont even much like to be around coughing.

First thing is to clean it well. Ive left on Peetas undershorts because theyre not in bad shape and I dont want to pull them over the swollen thigh and, all right, maybe the idea of him being naked makes me uncomfortable. Thats another thing about my mother and Prim. Nakedness has no effect on them, gives them no cause for embarrassment. Ironically, at this point in the Games, my little sister would be of far more use to Peeta than I am. I scoot my square of plastic under him so I can wash down the rest of him. With each bottle I pour over him, the worse the wound looks. The rest of his lower body has fared pretty well, just one tracker jacker sting and a few small burns that I treat quickly. But the gash on his leg . . . What on earth can I do for that? Why dont we give it some air and then . . . I trail off. And then youll patch it up? says Peeta. He looks almost sorry for me, as if he knows how lost I am. Thats right, I say. In the meantime, you eat these. I put a few dried pear halves in his hand and go back in the stream to wash the rest of his clothes. When theyre flattened out and drying, I examine the contents of the first-aid kit. Its pretty basic stuff. Bandages, fever pills, medicine to calm stomachs. Nothing of the caliber Ill need to treat Peeta. Were going to have to experiment some, I admit. I know the tracker jacker leaves

draw out infection, so I start with those. Within minutes of pressing the handful of chewed-up green stuff into the wound, pus begins running down the side of his leg. I tell myself this is a good thing and bite the inside of my cheek hard because my breakfast is threatening to make a reappearance. Katniss? Peeta says. I meet his eyes, knowing my face must be some shade of green. He mouths the words. How about that kiss? I burst out laughing because the whole thing is so revolting I cant stand it. Something wrong? he asks a little too

innocently. I . . . Im no good at this. Im not my mother. Ive no idea what Im doing and I hate pus, I say. Euh! I allow myself to let out a groan as I rinse away the first round of leaves and apply the second. Euuuh! How do you hunt? he asks. Trust me. Killing things is much easier than this, I say. Although for all I know, I am killing you. Can you speed it up a little? he asks. No. Shut up and eat your pears, I say. After three applications and what seems like a bucket of pus, the wound does look better. Now that the swelling has gone down, I can see how deep Catos sword cut. Right down to the bone. What next, Dr. Everdeen? he asks. Maybe Ill put some of the burn

ointment on it. I think it helps with infection anyway. And wrap it up? I say. I do and the whole thing seems a lot more manageable, covered in clean white cotton. Although, against the sterile bandage, the hem of his undershorts looks filthy and teeming with contagion. I pull out Rues backpack. Here, cover yourself with this and Ill wash your shorts. Oh, I dont care if you see me, says Peeta. Youre just like the rest of my family, I say. I care, all right? I turn my back and look at the stream until the undershorts splash into the current. He must be feeling a bit better if he can throw. You know, youre kind of squeamish for such a lethal person, says Peeta as I beat the shorts clean between two rocks. I wish Id let you give Haymitch a shower after all. I wrinkle my nose at the memory. Whats he sent you so far? Not a thing, says Peeta. Then theres a pause as it hits him. Why, did you get something? Burn medicine, I say almost sheepishly. Oh, and some bread. I always knew you were his favorite, says Peeta. Please, he cant stand being in the same room with me, I say. Because youre just alike, mutters Peeta. I ignore it though because this really isnt the time for me to be insulting Haymitch, which is my first impulse. I let Peeta doze off while his clothes dry out, but by late afternoon, I dont dare wait any longer. I gently shake his

shoulder. Peeta, weve got to go now. Go? He seems confused. Go where? Away from here. Downstream maybe. Somewhere we can hide you until youre stronger, I say. I help him dress, leaving his feet bare so we can walk in the water, and pull him upright. His face drains of color the moment he puts weight on his leg. Come on. You can do this. But he cant. Not for long anyway. We make it about fifty yards downstream, with him propped up by my shoulder, and I can tell hes going to black out. I sit him on the bank, push his head between his knees, and pat his back awkwardly as I survey the area. Of course, Id love to get him up in a tree, but thats not going to happen. It could be worse though. Some of the rocks form small cavelike structures. I set my sights on one about twenty yards above the stream. When Peetas able to stand, I half-guide, half-carry him up to the cave. Really, Id like to look around for a better place, but this one will have to do because my

ally is shot. Paper white, panting, and, even though its only just cooling off, hes shivering. I cover the floor of the cave with a layer of pine needles, unroll my sleeping bag, and tuck him into it. I get a couple of pills and some water into him

when hes not noticing, but he refuses to eat even the fruit. Then he just lies there, his eyes trained on my face as I build a sort of blind out of vines to conceal the mouth of the cave. The result is unsatisfactory. An animal might not question it, but a human would see hands had manufactured it quickly enough. I tear it down in frustration. Katniss, he says. I go over to him and brush the hair back from his eyes. Thanks for finding me. You would have found me if you could, I say. His foreheads burning up. Like the medicines having no effect at all. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Im scared hes going to die. Yes. Look, if I dont make it back he begins. Dont talk like that. I didnt drain all that pus for nothing, I say. I know. But just in case I dont he tries to continue. No, Peeta, I dont even want to discuss it, I say, placing my fingers on his lips to quiet him. But I he insists. Impulsively, I lean forward and kiss him, stopping his words. This is probably overdue anyway since hes right, we are supposed to be madly in love. Its the first time Ive ever kissed a boy, which should make some sort of impression I guess, but all I can register is how unnaturally hot his lips are from the fever. I break away and pull the edge of the sleeping bag up around him. Youre not going to die. I forbid it. All right? All right, he whispers. I step out in the cool

evening air just as the parachute floats down from the sky. My fingers quickly undo the tie, hoping for some real medicine to treat Peetas leg. Instead I find a pot of hot broth. Haymitch couldnt be sending me a clearer message. One kiss equals one pot of broth. I can almost hear his snarl. Youre supposed to be in love, sweetheart. The boys dying. Give me something I can work with! And hes right. If I want to keep Peeta alive, Ive got to give the audience something more to care about. Star-crossed lovers desperate to get home together. Two hearts beating as one. Romance. Never having been in love, this is going to be a real trick. I think of my parents. The way my father never failed to bring her gifts from the woods. The way my mothers face would light up at the sound of his boots at the door. The way she almost stopped living when he died. Peeta! I say, trying for the special tone that my mother used only with my father. Hes dozed off again, but I kiss him awake, which seems to startle him. Then he smiles as if hed be happy to lie there gazing at me forever. Hes great at this stuff. I hold up the pot. Peeta, look what Haymitch has sent you.

20.

Getting the broth into Peeta takes an hour of coaxing, begging, threatening, and yes, kissing, but finally, sip by sip, he empties the pot. I let him drift off to sleep then and attend to my own needs, wolfing down a supper of

groosling and roots while I watch the daily report in the sky. No new casualties. Still, Peeta and I have given the audience a fairly interesting day. Hopefully, the Gamemakers will allow us a peaceful night. I automatically look around for a good tree to nest in before I realize thats over. At least for a while. I cant very well leave Peeta unguarded on the ground. I left the scene of his last hiding place on the bank of the stream untouched how could I conceal it? and were a scant fifty yards downstream. I put on my glasses, place my weapons in readiness, and settle down to keep watch. The temperature drops rapidly and soon Im chilled to the bone. Eventually, I give in and slide into the sleeping bag with Peeta. Its toasty warm and I snuggle down gratefully until I realize its more than warm, its overly hot because the bag is reflecting back his fever. I check his forehead and find it burning and dry. I dont know what to do. Leave him in the bag and hope the excessive heat breaks the

fever? Take him out and hope the night air cools him off? I end up just dampening a strip of bandage and placing it on his forehead. It seems weak, but Im afraid to do anything too drastic. I spend the night half-sitting, half-lying next to Peeta, refreshing the bandage, and trying not to dwell on the fact that by teaming up with him, Ive made myself far more vulnerable than when I was alone. Tethered to the ground, on guard, with a very sick person to take care of. But I knew he was injured. And still I came after him. Im just going to have to trust that whatever instinct sent me to find him was a good one. When the sky turns rosy, I notice the sheen of sweat on Peetas lip and discover the fever has broken. Hes not back to normal, but its come down a few degrees. Last night, when I was gathering vines, I came upon a bush of Rues berries. I strip off the fruit and mash it up in the broth pot with cold water. Peetas struggling to get up when I reach the cave. I woke up and you were gone, he says. I was worried about you. I have to laugh as I ease him back down. You were worried about me? Have you taken a look at yourself lately? I thought Cato and Clove might have found you. They like to hunt at night, he says, still serious. Clove? Which one is that? I ask. The girl from District Two. Shes still alive, right? he

says. Yes, theres just them and us and Thresh and Foxface, I say. Thats what I nicknamed the girl from Five. How do you feel? Better than yesterday. This is an enormous improvement over the mud, he says. Clean clothes and medicine and a sleeping bag . . . And you. Oh, right, the whole romance thing. I reach out to touch his cheek and he catches my hand and presses it against his lips. I remember my father doing this very thing to my mother and I wonder where Peeta picked it up. Surely not from his father and the witch. No more kisses for you until youve eaten, I say. We get him propped up against the wall and he obediently swallows the spoonfuls of the

berry mush I feed him. He refuses the groosling again, though. You didnt sleep, Peeta says. Im all right, I say. But the truth is, Im exhausted. Sleep now. Ill keep watch. Ill wake you if anything happens, he says. I hesitate. Katniss, you cant stay up forever. Hes got a point there. Ill have to sleep eventually. And probably better to do it now when he seems relatively alert and we have daylight on our side. All right, I say. But just for a few hours. Then you wake me. Its too warm for the sleeping bag now. I smooth it out on the cave floor and lie down, one hand on my loaded bow in

case I have to shoot at a moments notice. Peeta sits beside me, leaning against the wall, his bad leg stretched out before him, his eyes trained on the world outside. Go to sleep, he says softly. His hand brushes the loose strands of my hair off my forehead. Unlike the staged kisses and caresses so far, this gesture seems natural and comforting. I dont want him to stop and he doesnt. Hes still stroking my hair when I fall asleep. Too long. I sleep too long. I know from the moment I open my eyes that were into the afternoon. Peetas right beside me, his position unchanged. I sit up, feeling somehow defensive but better rested than Ive been in days. Peeta, you were supposed to wake me after a couple of hours, I say. For what? Nothings going on here, he says. Besides I like watching you sleep. You dont scowl. Improves your looks a lot. This, of course, brings on a scowl that makes him grin. Thats when I notice how dry his lips are. I test his cheek. Hot as a coal stove. He claims hes been drinking, but the containers still feel full to me. I give him more fever pills and stand over him while he drinks first one, then a second quart of water. Then I tend to his minor wounds, the burns, the stings, which are showing improvement. I steel myself and unwrap the leg. My heart drops into my stomach. Its worse, much worse. Theres no

more pus in evidence, but the swelling has increased and the tight shiny skin is inflamed. Then I see the red streaks starting to crawl up his leg. Blood poisoning. Unchecked, it will kill him for sure. My chewed-up leaves and ointment wont make a dent in it. Well need strong anti-infection drugs from the Capitol. I cant imagine the cost of such potent medicine. If Haymitch pooled every donation from every sponsor, would he have enough? I doubt it. Gifts go up in price the longer the Games continue. What buys a full meal on day one buys a cracker on day twelve. And the kind of medicine Peeta needs would have been at a premium from the beginning. Well, theres more swelling, but the pus is gone, I say in an unsteady voice. I know what blood poisoning is, Katniss, says Peeta. Even if my mother isnt a healer. Youre just going to have to outlast the others, Peeta. Theyll cure it back at the Capitol when we win, I say. Yes, thats a good plan, he says. But I feel this is mostly for my benefit. You have to eat. Keep your strength up. Im going to make you

soup, I say. Dont light a fire, he says. Its not worth it. Well see, I say. As I take the pot down to the stream, Im struck by how brutally hot it is. I swear the

Gamemakers are progressively ratcheting up the temperature in the daytime and sending it plummeting at night. The heat of the sun-baked stones by the stream gives me an idea though. Maybe I wont need to light a fire. I settle down on a big flat rock halfway between the stream and the cave. After purifying half a pot of water, I place it in direct sunlight and add several egg-size hot stones to the water. Im the first to admit Im not much of a cook. But since soup mainly involves tossing everything in a pot and waiting, its one of my better dishes. I mince groosling until its practically mush and mash some of Rues roots. Fortunately, theyve both been roasted already so they mostly need to be heated up. Already, between the sunlight and the rocks, the waters warm. I put in the meat and roots, swap in fresh rocks, and go find something green to spice it up a little. Before long, I discover a tuft of chives growing at the base of some rocks. Perfect. I chop them very fine and add them to the pot, switch out the rocks again, put on the lid, and let the whole thing stew. Ive seen very few signs of game around, but I dont feel comfortable leaving Peeta alone while I hunt, so I rig half a dozen snares and hope I get lucky. I wonder about the other tributes, how theyre managing now that their main source of food has been blown up.

At least three of them, Cato, Clove, and Foxface, had been relying on it. Probably not Thresh though. Ive got a feeling he must share some of Rues knowledge on how to feed yourself from the earth. Are they fighting each other? Looking for us? Maybe one of them has located us and is just waiting for the right moment to attack. The idea sends me back to the cave. Peetas stretched out on top of the sleeping bag in the shade of the rocks. Although he brightens a bit when I come in, its clear he feels miserable. I put cool cloths on his head, but they warm up almost as soon as they touch his skin. Do you want anything? I ask. No, he says. Thank you. Wait, yes. Tell me a story. A story? What about? I say. Im not much for storytelling. Its kind of like singing. But once in a while, Prim wheedles one out of me. Something happy. Tell me about the happiest day you can remember, says Peeta. Something between a sigh and a huff of exasperation leaves my mouth. A happy story? This will require a lot more effort than the soup. I rack my brains for good memories. Most of them involve Gale and me out hunting and somehow I dont think these will play well with either Peeta or the audience. That leaves Prim. Did I ever tell you about how I got Prims goat? I ask. Peeta shakes his head, and looks at me expectantly. So I begin. But carefully.

Because my words are going out all over Panem. And while people have no doubt put two and two together that I hunt illegally, I dont want to hurt Gale

or Greasy Sae or the butcher or even the Peacekeepers back home who are my customers by publicly announcing theyd breaking the law, too. Heres the real story of how I got the money for Prims goat, Lady. It was a Friday evening, the day before Prims tenth birthday in late May. As soon as school ended, Gale and I hit the woods, because I wanted to get enough to trade for a present for Prim. Maybe some new cloth for a dress or a hairbrush. Our snares had done well enough and the woods were flush with greens, but this was really no more than our average Friday-night haul. I was disappointed as we headed back, even though Gale said wed be sure to do better tomorrow. We were resting a moment by a stream when we saw him. A young buck, probably a yearling by his size. His antlers were just growing in, still small and coated in velvet. Poised to run but unsure of us, unfamiliar with humans. Beautiful. Less beautiful perhaps when the two arrows caught him, one in the neck, the other in the chest. Gale and I had shot at the same time. The buck tried to run but stumbled, and

Gales knife slit his throat before he knew what had happened. Momentarily, Id felt a pang at killing something so fresh and innocent. And then my stomach rumbled at the thought of all that fresh and innocent meat. A deer! Gale and I have only brought down three in all. The first one, a doe that had injured her leg somehow, almost didnt count. But we knew from that experience not to go dragging the carcass into the Hob. It had caused chaos with people bidding on parts and actually trying to hack off pieces themselves. Greasy Sae had intervened and sent us with our deer to the butcher, but not before itd been badly damaged, hunks of meat taken, the hide riddled with holes. Although everybody paid up fairly, it had lowered the value of the kill. This time, we waited until dark fell and slipped under a hole in the fence close to the butcher. Even though we were known hunters, it wouldnt have been good to go carrying a 150-pound deer through the streets of District 12 in daylight like we were rubbing it in the officials faces. The butcher, a short, chunky woman named Rooba, came to the back door when we knocked. You dont haggle with Rooba. She gives you one price, which you can take or leave, but its a fair price. We took her offer on the deer and she threw in a couple of venison steaks we could pick up after the

butchering. Even with the money divided in two, neither Gale nor I had held so much at one time in our lives. We decided to keep it a secret and surprise our families with the meat and money at the end of the next day. This is where I really got the money for the goat, but I tell Peeta I sold an old silver locket of my mothers. That cant hurt anyone. Then I pick up the story in the late afternoon of Prims birthday. Gale and I went to the market on the square so that I could buy dress materials. As I was running my fingers over a length of thick blue cotton cloth, something caught my

eye. Theres an old man who keeps a small herd of goats on the other side of the Seam. I dont know his real name, everyone just calls him the Goat Man. His joints are swollen and twisted in painful angles, and hes got a hacking cough that proves he spent years in the mines. But hes lucky. Somewhere along the way he saved up enough for these goats and now has something to do in his old age besides slowly starve to death. Hes filthy and impatient, but the goats are clean and their milk is rich if you can afford it. One of the goats, a white one with black patches, was lying down in a cart. It was easy to see why. Something, probably a dog, had mauled her

shoulder and infection had set in. It was bad, the Goat Man had to hold her up to milk her. But I thought I knew someone who could fix it. Gale, I whispered. I want that goat for Prim. Owning a nanny goat can change your life in District 12. The animals can live off almost anything, the Meadows a perfect feeding place, and they can give four quarts of milk a day. To drink, to make into cheese, to sell. Its not even against the law. Shes hurt pretty bad, said Gale. We better take a closer look. We went over and bought a cup of milk to share, then stood over the goat as if idly curious. Let her be, said the man. Just looking, said Gale. Well, look fast. She goes to the butcher soon. Hardly anyone will buy her milk, and then they only pay half price, said the man. Whats the butcher giving for her? I asked. The man shrugged. Hang around and see. I turned and saw Rooba coming across the square toward us. Lucky thing you showed up, said the Goat Man when she arrived. Girls got her eye on your goat. Not if shes spoken for, I said carelessly. Rooba looked me up and down then frowned at the goat. Shes not. Look at that shoulder. Bet you half the carcass will be too rotten for even sausage. What? said the Goat Man. We had a deal. We had a deal on an animal with a few teeth marks. Not that thing. Sell her to the girl if shes stupid enough to take

her, said Rooba. As she marched off, I caught her wink. The Goat Man was mad, but he still wanted that goal off his hands. It took us half an hour to agree on the price. Quite a crowd had gathered by then to hand out opinions. It was an excellent deal if the goat lived; Id been robbed if she died. People took sides in the argument, but I took the goat. Gale offered to carry her. I think he wanted to see the look on Prims face as much as I did. In a moment of complete giddiness, I bought a pink ribbon and tied it around her neck. Then we hurried back to my house. You should have seen Prims reaction when we walked in with that goat. Remember this is a girl who wept to save that awful old cat, Buttercup. She was so excited she started crying and laughing all at once. My mother was less sure, seeing the injury, but the pair of them went to work on it, grinding up herbs and coaxing brews down the animals throat. They sound like you, says Peeta. I had almost forgotten he

was there. Oh, no, Peeta. They work magic. That thing couldnt have died if it tried, I say. But then I bite my tongue, realizing what that must sound like to Peeta, who is dying, in my incompetent hands. Dont worry. Im not trying, he jokes. Finish

the story. Well, thats it. Only I remember that night, Prim insisted on sleeping with Lady on a blanket next to the fire. And just before they drifted off, the goat licked her cheek, like it was giving her a good night kiss or something, I say. It was already mad about her. Was it still wearing the pink ribbon? he asks. I think so, I say. Why? Im just trying to get a picture, he says thoughtfully. I can see why that day made you happy. Well, I knew that goat would be a little gold mine, 1 say. Yes, of course I was referring to that, not the lasting joy you gave the sister you love so much you took her place in the reaping, says Peeta drily. The goat has paid for itself. Several times over, I say in a superior tone. Well, it wouldnt dare do anything else after you saved its life, says Peeta. I intend to do the same thing. Really? What did you cost me again? I ask. A lot of trouble. Dont worry. Youll get it all back, he says. Youre not making sense, I say. I test his forehead. The levers going nowhere but up. Youre a little cooler though. The sound of the trumpets startles me. Im on my feet and at the mouth of the cave in a flash, not wanting to miss a syllable. Its my new best friend, Claudius Templesmith, and as I expected, hes inviting us to a feast. Well, were not that hungry and I actually wave his offer away in indifference when he says, Now

hold on. Some of you may already be declining my invitation. But this is no ordinary feast. Each of you needs something desperately. I do need something desperately. Something to heal Peetas leg. Each of you will find that something in a backpack, marked with your district number, at the Cornucopia at dawn. Think hard about refusing to show up. For some of you, this will be your last chance, says Claudius. Theres nothing else, just his words hanging in the air. I jump as Peeta grips my shoulder from behind. No, he says. Youre not risking your life for me. Who said I was? I say. So, youre not going? he asks. Of course, Im not going. Give me some credit. Do you think Im running straight into some free-for-all against Cato and Clove and Thresh? Dont be stupid, I say, helping him back to bed. Ill let them fight it out, well see whos in the sky tomorrow night and work out a plan from there. Youre such a bad liar, Katniss. I dont know how youve survived this long. He begins to mimic me. I knew that goat would be a little gold mine. Youre a little cooler though. Of course, Im not going. He shakes his head. Never gamble at cards. Youll lose your last coin, he says. Anger flushes my face. All right, I am going, and you cant stop me! I can follow you. At least partway. I may not make it to the Cornucopia, but if Im yelling your

name, I bet someone can find me. And then

Ill be dead for sure, he says. You wont get a hundred yards from here on that leg, I say. Then Ill drag myself, says Peeta. You go and Im going, too. Hes just stubborn enough and maybe just strong enough to do it. Come howling after me in the woods. Even if a tribute doesnt find him, something else might. He cant defend himself. Id probably have to wall him up in the cave just to go myself. And who knows what the exertion will do to him? What am I supposed to do? Sit here and watch you die? I say. He must know thats not an option. That the audience would hate me. And frankly, I would hate myself, too, if I didnt even try. I wont die. I promise. If you promise not to go, he says. Were at something of a stalemate. I know I cant argue him out of this one, so I dont try. I pretend, reluctantly, to go along. Then you have to do what I say. Drink your water, wake me when I tell you, and eat every bite of the soup no matter how disgusting it is! I snap at him. Agreed. Is it ready? he asks. Wait here, I say. The airs gone cold even though the suns still up. Im right about the Gamemakers messing with the temperature. I wonder if the thing

someone needs desperately is a good blanket. The soup is still nice and warm in its iron pot. And actually doesnt taste too bad. Peeta eats without complaint, even scraping out the pot to show his enthusiasm. He rambles on about how delicious it is, which should be encouraging if you dont know what fever does to people. Hes like listening to Haymitch before the alcohol has soaked him into incoherence. I give him another dose of fever medicine before he goes off his head completely. As I go down to the stream to wash up, all I can think is that hes going to die if I dont get to that feast. Ill keep him going for a day or two, and then the infection will reach his heart or his brain or his lungs and hell be gone. And Ill be here all alone. Again. Waiting for the others. Im so lost in thought that I almost miss the parachute, even though it floats right by me. Then I spring after it, yanking it from the water, tearing off the silver fabric to retrieve the vial. Haymitch has done it! Hes gotten the medicine I dont know how, persuaded some gaggle of romantic fools to sell their jewels and I can save Peeta! Its such a tiny vial though. It must be very strong to cure someone as ill as Peeta. A ripple of doubt runs through me. I uncork the vial and take a deep sniff. My spirits fall at the sickly sweet scent. Just to be sure, I place a drop on the tip of my

tongue. Theres no question, its sleep syrup. Its a common medicine in District 12. Cheap, as medicine goes, but very addictive. Almost everyones had a dose at one time or another. We have some in a bottle at home. My mother gives it to hysterical patients to knock them out to stitch up a bad wound or quiet their minds or just to help someone in pain get through the night. It only takes a little. A vial this size could knock Peeta out for a full day, but what good is that? Im

so furious Im about to throw Haymitchs last offering into the stream when it hits me. A full day? Thats more than I need. I mash up a handful of berries so the taste wont be as noticeable and add some mint leaves for good measure. Then I head back up to the cave. Ive brought you a treat. I found a new patch of berries a little farther downstream. Peeta opens his mouth for the first bite without hesitation. He swallows then frowns slightly. Theyre very sweet. Yes, theyre sugar berries. My mother makes jam from them. Havent you ever had them before? I say, poking the next spoonful in his mouth. No, he says, almost puzzled. But they taste familiar. Sugar berries? Well, you cant get them in the market much, they only grow wild, I say. Another mouthful

goes down. Just one more to go. Theyre sweet as syrup, he says, taking the last spoonful. Syrup. His eyes widen as he realizes the truth. I clamp my hand over his mouth and nose hard, forcing him to swallow instead of spit. He tries to make himself vomit the stuff up, but its too late, hes already losing consciousness. Even as he fades away, I can see in his eyes what Ive done is unforgivable. I sit back on my heels and look at him with a mixture of sadness and satisfaction. A stray berry stains his chin and I wipe it away. Who cant lie, Peeta? I say, even though he cant hear me. It doesnt matter. The rest of Panem can.

21.

In the remaining hours before nightfall, I gather rocks and do my best to camouflage the opening of the cave. Its a slow and arduous process, but after a lot of sweating and shifting things around, Im pretty pleased with my work, The cave now appears to be part of a larger pile of rocks, like so many in the vicinity. I can still crawl in to Peeta through a small opening, but its undetectable from the out side.

Thats good, because Ill need to share that sleeping bag again tonight. Also, if I dont make it back from the feast, Peeta will be hidden but not entirely imprisoned. Although I doubt he can hang on much longer without medicine. If I die at the feast, District 12 isnt likely to have a victor. I make a meal out of the smaller, bonier fish that inhabit the stream down here, fill every water container and purify it, and clean my weapons. Ive nine arrows left in all. I debate leaving the knife with Peeta so hell have some protection while Im gone, but theres really no point. He was right about camouflage being his final defense. But I still might have use for the knife. Who knows what Ill encounter? Here are some things Im fairly certain of. That at least Cato, Clove, and Thresh will be on hand when the feast starts. Im not sure about Foxface since direct confrontation isnt her style or her forte. Shes even smaller than I am and unarmed, unless shes picked up some weapons recently. Shell probably be hanging somewhere nearby, seeing what she can scavenge. But the other three . . . Im going to have my hands full. My ability to kill at a distance is my greatest asset, but I know Ill have to go


right into the thick of things to get that backpack, the one with the number 12 on it that Claudius Templesmith mentioned. I watch the sky, hoping for one less opponent at dawn, but nobody appears tonight. Tomorrow there will be faces up there. Feasts always result in fatalities. I crawl into the cave, secure my glasses, and curl up next to Peeta. Luckily I had that good long sleep today. I have to stay awake. I dont really think anyone will attack our cave tonight, but I cant risk missing the dawn. So cold, so bitterly cold tonight. As if the Gamemakers have sent an infusion of frozen air across the arena, which may be exactly what theyve done. I lay next to Peeta in the bag, trying to absorb every bit of his fever heat. Its strange to be so physically close to someone whos so distant. Peeta might as well be back in the Capitol, or in District 12, or on the moon right now, hed be no harder to reach. Ive never felt lonelier since the Games began. Just accept it will be a bad night, I tell myself. I try not to, but I cant help thinking of my mother and Prim, wondering if theyll sleep a wink tonight. At this late stage in the Games, with an important event like the feast, school will probably be canceled. My family can either watch on that static-filled old clunker of a television at home or join the crowds in the square to

watch on the big, clear screens, Theyll have privacy at home but support in the square. People will give them a kind word, a bit of food if they can spare it. I wonder if the baker has sought them out, especially now that Peeta and I are a team, and made good on his promise to keep my sisters belly full. Spirits must be running high in District 12. We so rarely have anyone to root for at this point in the Games. Surely, people are excited about Peeta and me, especially now that were together. If I close my eyes, I can imagine their shouts at the screens, urging us on. I see their faces Greasy Sac and Madge and even the Peacekeepers who buy my meat cheering for us. And Gale. I know him. He wont be shouting and cheering. But hell be watching, every moment, every twist and turn, and willing me to come home. I wonder if hes hoping that Peeta makes it as well. Gales not my boyfriend, but would he be, if I opened that door? He talked about us running away together. Was that just a practical calculation of our chances of survival away from the district? Or something more? I wonder what he makes of all this kissing. Through a crack in the rocks, I watch the moon cross the sky. At what I judge to be about three hours before dawn, I begin final preparations. Im careful to leave Peeta with water and the medical kit right beside him. Nothing

else will be of much use if I dont return, and even these would only prolong his life a short time. After some debate, I strip him of his jacket and zip it on over my own. He doesnt need it. Not now in the sleeping bag with his fever, and during the day, if Im not there to remove it, hell be roasting in

it. My hands are already stiff from cold, so I take Rues spare pair of socks, cut holes for my fingers and thumbs, and pull them on. It helps anyway. I fill her small pack with some food, a water bottle, and bandages, tuck the knife in my belt, get my bow and arrows. Im about to leave when I remember the importance of sustaining the star-crossed lover routine and I lean over and give Peeta a long, lingering kiss. I imagine the teary sighs emanating from the Capitol and pretend to brush away a tear of my own. Then I squeeze through the opening in the rocks out into the night. My breath makes small white clouds as it hits the air. Its as cold as a November night at home. One where Ive slipped into the woods, lantern in hand, to join Gale at some prearranged place where well sit bundled together, sipping herb tea from metal flasks wrapped in quilting, hoping game will pass our way as the morning comes on. Oh,

Gale, I think. If only you had my back now . . . I move as fast as I dare. The glasses are quite remarkable, but I still sorely miss having the use of my left ear. I dont know what the explosion did, but it damaged something deep and irreparable. Never mind. If I get home, Ill be so stinking rich, Ill be able to pay someone to do my hearing. The woods always look different at night. Even with the glasses, everything has an unfamiliar slant to it. As if the daytime trees and flowers and stones had gone to bed and sent slightly more ominous versions of themselves to take their places. I dont try anything tricky, like taking a new route. I make my way back up the stream and follow the same path back to Rues hiding place near the lake. Along the way, I see no sign of another tribute, not a puff of breath, not a quiver of a branch. Either Im the first to arrive or the others positioned themselves last night. Theres still more than an hour, maybe two, when I wriggle into the underbrush and wait for the blood to begin to flow. I chew a few mint leaves, my stomach isnt up for much more. Thank goodness, I have Peetas jacket as well as my own. If not, Id be forced to move around to stay warm. The sky turns a misty morning gray and still theres no sign of the other tributes. Its not surprising really. Everyone has distinguished themselves either by

strength or deadliness or cunning. Do they suppose, I wonder, that I have Peeta with me? I doubt Foxface and Thresh even know he was wounded. All the better if they think hes covering me when I go in for the backpack. But where is it? The arena has lightened enough for me to remove my glasses. I can hear the morning birds singing. Isnt it time? For a second, Im panicked that Im at the wrong location. But no, Im certain I remember Claudius Templesmith specifying the Cornucopia. And there it is. And here I am. So wheres my feast? Just as the first ray of sun glints off the gold Cornucopia, theres a disturbance on the plain. The ground before the mouth of the horn splits in two and a round table with a snowy white

cloth rises into the arena. On the table sit four backpacks, two large black ones with the numbers 2 and 11, a medium-size green one with the number 5, and a tiny orange one really I could carry it around my wrist that must be marked with a 12. The table has just clicked into place when a figure darts out of the Cornucopia, snags the green backpack, and speeds off. Foxface! Leave it to her to come up with such a clever and risky idea! The rest of us are still poised around the plain, sizing up the

situation, and shes got hers. Shes got us trapped, too, because no one wants to chase her down, not while their own pack sits so vulnerable on the table. Foxface must have purposefully left the other packs alone, knowing that to steal one without her number would definitely bring on a pursuer. That should have been my strategy! By the lime Ive worked through the emotions of surprise, admiration, anger, jealousy, and frustration, Im watching that reddish mane of hair disappear into the trees well out of shooting range. Huh. Im always dreading the others, but maybe Foxface is the real opponent here. Shes cost me time, too, because by now its clear that I must get to the table next. Anyone who beats me to it will easily scoop up my pack and be gone. Without hesitation, I sprint for the table. I can sense the emergence of danger before I see it. Fortunately, the first knife comes whizzing in on my right side so I can hear it and Im able to deflect it with my bow. I turn, drawing back the bowstring and send an arrow straight at Cloves heart. She turns just enough to avoid a fatal hit, but the point punctures her upper left arm. Unfortunately, she throws with her right, but its enough to slow her down a few moments, having to pull the arrow from her arm, take in the severity of the wound. I keep moving, positioning

the next arrow automatically, as only someone who has hunted for years can do. Im at the table now, my fingers closing over the tiny orange backpack. My hand slips between the straps and I yank it up on my arm, its really too small to fit on any other part of my anatomy, and Im turning to fire again when the second knife catches me in the forehead. It slices above my right eyebrow, opening a gash that sends a gush running down my face, blinding my eye, filling my mouth with the sharp, metallic taste of my own blood. I stagger backward but still manage to send my readied arrow in the general direction of my assailant. I know as it leaves my hands it will miss. And then Clove slams into me, knocking me flat on my back, pinning my shoulders to the ground, with her knees. This is it, I think, and hope for Prims sake it will be fast. But Clove means to savor the moment. Even feels she has time. No doubt Cato is somewhere nearby, guarding her, waiting for Thresh and possibly Peeta. Wheres your boyfriend, District Twelve? Still hanging on? she asks. Well, as long as were talking Im alive. Hes out there now. Hunting Cato, I snarl at her. Then I scream at

the top of my lungs. Peeta! Clove jams her fist into my windpipe, very

effectively cutting off my voice. But her heads whipping from side to side, and I know for a moment shes at least considering Im telling the truth. Since no Peeta appears to save me, she turns back to me. Liar, she says with a grin. Hes nearly dead. Cato knows where he cut him. Youve probably got him strapped up in some tree while you try to keep his heart going. Whats in the pretty little backpack? That medicine for Lover Boy? Too bad hell never get it. Clove opens her jacket. Its lined with an impressive array of knives. She carefully selects an almost dainty-looking number with a cruel, curved blade. I promised Cato if he let me have you, Id give the audience a good show. Im struggling now in an effort to unseat her, but its no use. Shes too heavy and her lock on me too tight. Forget it, District Twelve. Were going to kill you. Just like we did your pathetic little ally . . . What was her name? The one who hopped around in the trees? Rue? Well, first Rue, then you, and then I think well just let nature take care of Lover Boy. How does that sound? Clove asks. Now, where to start? She carelessly wipes away the blood from my wound with her jacket sleeve. For a moment, she surveys my face, tilting it from side to side as if its a block of wood and shes deciding exactly what pattern to carve on it. I attempt to bite her hand, but she

grabs the hair on the top of my head, forcing me back to the ground. I think . . . She almost purrs. I think well start with your mouth. I clamp my teeth together as she teasingly traces the outline of my lips with the tip of the blade. I wont close my eyes. The comment about Rue has filled me with fury, enough fury I think to die with some dignity. As my last act of defiance, I will stare her down as long as I can see, which will probably not be an extended period of time, but I will stare her down, I will not cry out. I will die, in my own small way, undefeated. Yes, I dont think youll have much use for your lips anymore. Want to blow Lover Boy one last kiss? she asks, I work up a mouthful of blood and saliva and spit it in her face. She flushes with rage. All right then. Lets get started. I brace myself for the agony thats sure to follow. But as I feel the tip open the first cut at my lip, some great form yanks Clove from my body and then shes screaming. Im too stunned at first, too unable to process what has happened. Has Peeta somehow come to my rescue? Have the Gamemakers sent in some wild animal to add to the fun? Has a hovercraft inexplicably plucked her into the air? But when I push myself up on my numb arms, I see its none of the above. Clove is dangling a foot off the ground, imprisoned in Threshs arms. I let out a gasp,

seeing him like that, towering over me, holding Clove like a rag doll. I remember him as big, but he seems more massive, more powerful than I even recall. If anything, he seems to have gained weight in the arena. He flips

Clove around and flings her onto the ground. When he shouts, I jump, never having heard him speak above a mutter. Whatd you do to that little girl? You kill her? Clove is scrambling backward on all fours, like a frantic insect, too shocked to even call for Cato. No! No, it wasnt me! You said her name. I heard you. You kill her? Another thought brings a fresh wave of rage to his features. You cut her up like you were going to cut up this girl here? No! No, I Clove sees the stone, about the size of a small loaf of bread in Threshs hand and loses it. Cato! she screeches. Cato! Clove! I hear Catos answer, but hes too far away, I can tell that much, to do her any good. What was he doing? Trying to get Foxface or Peeta? Or had he been lying in wait for Thresh and just badly misjudged his location? Thresh brings the rock down hard against Cloves temple. Its not bleeding, but I can see the dent in her skull and I know that shes a goner. Theres still life in her now though, in the rapid rise and fall of her

chest, the low moan escaping her lips. When Thresh whirls around on me, the rock raised, I know its no good to run. And my bow is empty, the last loaded arrow having gone in Cloves direction. Im trapped in the glare of his strange golden brown eyes. Whatd she mean? About Rue being your ally? I I we teamed up. Blew up the supplies. I tried to save her, I did. But he got there first. District One, I say. Maybe if he knows I helped Rue, he wont choose some slow, sadistic end for me. And you killed him? he demands. Yes. I killed him. And buried her in flowers, I say. And I sang her to sleep. Tears spring in my eyes. The tension, the fight goes out of me at the memory. And Im overwhelmed by Rue, and the pain in my head, and my fear of Thresh, and the moaning of the dying girl a few feet away. To sleep? Thresh says gruffly. To death. I sang until she died, I say. Your district. . . They sent me bread. My hand reaches up but not for an arrow that I know Ill never reach. Just to wipe my nose. Do it fast, okay, Thresh? Conflicting emotions cross Threshs face. He lowers the rock and points at me, almost accusingly. Just this one time, I let you go. For the little girl. You and me, were even then. No more owed. You understand? I nod because I do understand. About owing. About hating it. I understand that if Thresh

wins, hell have to go back and face a district that has already broken all the rules to thank me, and he is breaking the rules to thank me, too. And I understand that, for the moment, Thresh is not going to smash in my skull. Clove! Catos voice is much nearer now. I can tell by the pain in it that he sees her on the ground. You better run now, Fire Girl, says Thresh. I dont need to be told twice. I flip over and my feet dip into the hard-packed earth as I run away from Thresh and Clove and the sound of Catos voice. Only when I reach the woods do I turn back for an instant. Thresh and both large backpacks are vanishing over the edge of the plain into the

area Ive never seen. Cato kneels beside Clove, spear in hand, begging her to stay with him. In a moment, he will realize its futile, she cant be saved. I crash into the trees, repeatedly swiping away the blood thats pouring into my eye, fleeing like the wild, wounded creature I am. After a few minutes, I hear the cannon and I know that Clove has died, that Cato will be on one of our trails. Either Threshs or mine. Im seized with terror, weak from my head wound, shaking. I load an arrow, but Cato can throw that spear almost as far as I can shoot. Only one thing calms me down. Thresh

has Catos backpack containing the thing he needs desperately. If I had to bet, Cato headed out after Thresh, not me. Still I dont slow down when I reach the water. I plunge right in, boots still on, and flounder downstream. I pull off Rues socks that Ive been using for gloves and press them into my forehead, trying to staunch the flow of blood, but theyre soaked in minutes. Somehow I make it back to the cave. I squeeze through the rocks. In the dappled light, I pull the little orange backpack from my arm, cut open the clasp, and dump the contents on the ground. One slim box containing one hypodermic needle. Without hesitating, I jam the needle into Peetas arm and slowly press down on the plunger. My hands go to my head and then drop to my lap, slick with blood. The last thing I remember is an exquisitely beautiful green-and-silver moth landing on the curve of my wrist.

22.

The sound of rain drumming on the roof of our house gently pulls me toward consciousness. I fight to return to sleep though, wrapped in a warm cocoon of

blankets, safe at home. Im vaguely aware that my head aches. Possibly I have the flu and this is why Im allowed to stay in bed, even though I can tell Ive been asleep a long time. My mothers hand strokes my cheek and I dont push it away as I would in wakefulness, never wanting her to know how much I crave that gentle touch. How much I miss her even though I still dont trust her. Then theres a voice, the wrong voice, not my mothers, and Im scared. Katniss, it says. Katniss, can you hear me? My eyes open and the sense of security vanishes. Im not home, not with my mother. Im in a dim, chilly cave, my bare feet freezing despite the cover, the air tainted with the unmistakable smell of blood. The haggard, pale face of a boy slides into view, and after an initial jolt of alarm, I feel better. Peeta. Hey, he says. Good to see your eyes again. How long have I been out? I ask. Not sure. I woke up yesterday evening and you were lying next to me in a very scary pool of blood, he says. I think its stopped finally, but I wouldnt sit up or anything. I gingerly lift my hand to my head and find it bandaged. This simple gesture leaves me weak and dizzy. Peeta holds a bottle to my lips and I drink thirstily. Youre better, I say. Much better. Whatever you shot into my arm did the trick, he says. By this morning, almost all the swelling in

my leg was gone. He

doesnt seem angry about my tricking him, drugging him, and running off to the feast. Maybe Im just too beat-up and Ill hear about it later when Im stronger. But for the moment, hes all gentleness. Did you eat? I ask. Im sorry to say I gobbled down three pieces of that groosling before I realized it might have to last a while. Dont worry, Im back on a strict diet, he says. No, its good. You need to eat. Ill go hunting soon, I say. Not too soon, all right? he says. You just let me take care of you for a while. I dont really seem to have much choice. Peeta feeds me bites of groosling and raisins and makes me drink plenty of water. He rubs some warmth back into my feet and wraps them in his jacket before tucking the sleeping bag back up around my chin. Your boots and socks are still damp and the weathers not helping much, he says. Theres a clap of thunder, and I see lightning electrify the sky through an opening in the rocks. Rain drips through several holes in the ceiling, but Peeta has built a sort of canopy over my head an upper body by wedging the square of plastic into the rock above me. I wonder what brought on this storm? I mean, whos the target? says Peeta.

Cato and Thresh, I say without thinking. Foxface will be in her den somewhere, and Clove . . . She cut me an then . . . My voice trails off. I know Cloves dead. I saw it in the sky last night, h says. Did you kill her? No. Thresh broke her skull with a rock, I say. Lucky he didnt catch you, too, says Peeta. The memory of the feast returns full-force and I feel sick. He did. But he let me go. Then, of course, I have to tell him. About things Ive kept to myself because he was too sick to ask and I wasnt ready to relive anyway. Like the explosion and my ear and Rues dying and the boy from District 1 and the bread. All of which leads to what happened with Thresh and how he was paying off a debt of sorts. He let you go because he didnt want to owe you anything? asks Peeta in disbelief. Yes. I dont expect you to understand it. Youve always had enough. But if youd lived in the Seam, I wouldnt have to explain, I say. And dont try. Obviously Im too dim to get it. Its like the bread. How I never seem to get over owing you for that, I say. The bread? What? From when we were kids? he says. I think we can let that go. I mean, you just brought me back from the dead. But you didnt know me. We had never even spoken. Besides, its the first gift thats always the hardest to pay back. I wouldnt even have been here to do it if you hadnt helped

me then, I say. Why did you, anyway? Why? You know why, Peeta says. I give my head a slight, painful shake. Haymitch said you would take a lot of convincing. Haymitch? I ask. Whats he got to do with it? Nothing, Peeta says. So, Cato and Thresh, huh? I guess its too much to hope that theyll simultaneously destroy each other? But the thought only upsets me. I think we would like Thresh. I think hed be our friend back in District Twelve, I say. Then lets hope Cato kills

him, so we dont have to, says Peeta grimly. I dont want Cato to kill Thresh at all. I dont want anyone else to die. But this is absolutely not the kind of thing that victors go around saying in the arena. Despite my best efforts, I can feel tears starting to pool in my eyes. Peeta looks at me in concern. What is it? Are you in a lot of pain? I give him another answer, because it is equally true but can be taken as a brief moment of weakness instead of a terminal one. I want to go home, Peeta, I say plaintively, like a small child. You will. I promise, he says, and bends over to give me a kiss. I want to go home now, I say. Tell you what. You go back to sleep and dream of home. And youll be there for real before you know it, lie says. Okay? Okay, I whisper.

Wake me if you need me to keep watch. Im good and rested, thanks to you and Haymitch. Besides, who knows how long this will last? he says. What does he mean? The storm? The brief respite ii brings us? The Games themselves? I dont know, but Im ion sad and tired to ask. Its evening when Peeta wakes me again. The rain has turned to a downpour, sending streams of water through our ceiling where earlier there had been only drips. Peeta has placed the broth pot under the worst one and repositioned the plastic to deflect most of it from me. I feel a bit better, able to sit up without getting too dizzy, and Im absolutely famished. So is Peeta. Its clear hes been waiting for me to wake up to eat and is eager to get started. Theres not much left. Two pieces of groosling, a small mishmash of roots, and a handful of dried fruit. Should we try and ration it? Peeta asks. No, lets just finish it. The grooslings getting old anyway, and the last thing we need is to get sick off spoiled food, I say, dividing the food into two equal piles. We try and eat slowly, but were both so hungry were done in a couple of minutes. My stomach is in no way satisfied. Tomorrows a hunting day, I say. I wont be much help with that, Peeta says. Ive never hunted before. Ill kill and you cook, I say. And you can always gather. I wish there was some sort of bread bush out there,

says Peeta. The bread they sent me from District Eleven was still warm, I say with a sigh. Here, chew these. I hand him a couple of mint leaves and pop a few in my own mouth. Its hard to even see the projection in the sky, but its clear enough to know there were no more deaths today. So Cato and Thresh havent had it out yet. Where did Thresh go? I mean, whats on the far side of the circle? I ask Peeta. A field. As far as you can see its full of grasses as high as my shoulders. I dont know, maybe some of them are grain. There are patches of different colors. But there are no paths, says Peeta. I bet some of them are grain. I bet Thresh knows which ones, too, I say. Did you go in there? No. Nobody really wanted to track Thresh down in that grass. It has a sinister feeling to it. Every time I look at that field, all I can think of are hidden things. Snakes, and

rabid animals, and quicksand, Peeta says. There could be anything in there. I dont say so but Peetas words remind me of the warnings they give us about not going beyond the fence in District 12. I cant help, for a moment, comparing him with Gale, who would see that field as a potential source of food as well as a threat. Thresh

certainly did. Its not that Peetas soft exactly, and hes proved hes not a coward. But there are things you dont question too much, I guess, when your home always smells like baking bread, whereas Gale questions everything. What would Peeta think of the irreverent banter that passes between us as we break the law each day? Would it shock him? The things we say about Panem? Gales tirades against the Capitol? Maybe there is a bread bush in that field, I say. Maybe thats why Thresh looks better fed now than when we started the Games. Either that or hes got very generous sponsors, says Peeta. I wonder what wed have to do to get Haymitch to send us some bread. I raise my eyebrows before I remember he doesnt know about the message Haymitch sent us a couple of nights ago. One kiss equals one pot of broth. Its not the sort of thing I can blurt out, either. To say my thoughts aloud would be tipping off the audience that the romance has been fabricated to play on their sympathies and that would result in no food at all. Somehow, believably, Ive got to get things back on track. Something simple to start with. I reach out and take his hand. Well, he probably used up a lot of resources helping me knock you out, I say mischievously. Yeah, about that, says Peeta, entwining his fingers in mine. Dont try something likethat again. Or what? I ask. Or . . . Or . . . He cant think of anything good. Just give me a minute. Whats the problem? I say with a grin. The problem is were both still alive. Which only reinforces the idea in your mind that you did the right thing, says Peeta. I did do the right thing, I say. No! Just dont, Katniss! His grip tightens, hurting my hand, and theres real anger in his voice. Dont die for me. You wont be doing me any favors. All right? Im startled by his intensity but recognize an excellent opportunity for getting food, so I try to keep up. Maybe I did it for myself, Peeta, did you ever think of that? Maybe you arent the only one who . . . Who worries about . . . What it would be like if. . . I fumble. Im not as smooth with words as Peeta. And while I was talking, the idea of actually losing Peeta hit me again and I realized how much I dont want him to die. And its not about the sponsors. And its not about what will happen back home. And its not just that I dont want to be alone. Its him. I do not want to lose the boy with the bread. If what, Katniss? he says softly. I wish I could pull the shutters closed, blocking out this moment from the prying eyes of Panem. Even if it means losing food. Whatever Im feeling, its no ones business but mine. Thats exactly the kind of topic Haymitch told me to steer clear of, I


say evasively, although Haymitch never said anything of the kind. In fact, hes probably cursing me out right now for dropping the ball during such an emotionally charged moment. But Peeta somehow catches it. Then Ill just have to fill in the blanks myself, he says, and moves in to me. This is the first kiss that were both fully aware of. Neither of us hobbled by sickness or pain or simply unconscious. Our lips neither burning with fever or icy cold. This is the first kiss where I actually feel stirring inside my chest. Warm and curious. This is the first kiss that makes me want another. But I dont get it. Well, I do get a second kiss, but its just a light one on the tip of my nose because Peetas been distracted. I think your wound is bleeding again. Come on, lie down, its bedtime anyway, he says. My socks are dry enough to wear now. I make Peeta put his jacket back on. The damp cold seems to cut right down to my bones, so he must be half frozen. I insist on taking the first watch, too, although neither of us think its likely anyone will come in this weather. But he wont agree unless Im in the bag, too, and Im shivering so hard that its pointless to object. In stark contrast to two nights ago, when I felt Peeta was a million miles away, Im struck by his immediacy now. As we settle in, he pulls my head down to use his arm as a pillow, the other restsprotectively over me even when he goes to sleep. No one has held me like this in such a long time. Since my father died and I stopped trusting my mother, no one elses arms have made me feel this safe. With the aid of the glasses, I lie watching the drips of water splatter on the cave floor. Rhythmic and lulling. Several times, I drift off briefly and then snap awake, guilty and angry with myself. After three or four hours, I cant help it, I have to rouse Peeta because I cant keep my eyes open. He doesnt seem to mind. Tomorrow, when its dry, Ill find us a place so high in the trees we can both sleep in peace, I promise as I drift off. But tomorrow is no better in terms of weather. The deluge continues as if the Gamemakers are intent on washing us all away. The thunders so powerful it seems to shake the ground. Peetas considering heading out anyway to scavenge for food, but I tell him in this storm it would be pointless. He wont be able to see three feet in front of his face and hell only end up getting soaked to the skin for his troubles. He knows Im right, but the gnawing in our stomachs is becoming painful. The day drags on turning into evening and theres no break in the weather. Haymitch is our only hope, but nothing is forthcoming, either from lack of money everything will cost an exorbitant amount or because hes

dissatisfied with our performance. Probably the latter. Id be the first to admit were not exactly riveting today. Starving, weak from injuries, trying not to reopen wounds. Were sitting huddled together wrapped in the sleeping bag, yes, but mostly to keep warm. The most exciting thing

either of us does is nap. Im not really sure how to ramp up the romance. The kiss last night was nice, but working up to another will take some forethought. There are girls in the Seam, some of the merchant girls, too, who navigate these waters so easily. But Ive never had much time or use for it. Anyway, just a kiss isnt enough anymore clearly because if it was wed have gotten food last night. My instincts tell me Haymitch isnt just looking for physical affection, he wants something more personal. The sort of stuff he was trying to get me to tell about myself when we were practicing for the interview. Im rotten at it, but Peetas not. Maybe the best approach is to get him talking. Peeta, I say lightly. You said at the interview youd had a crush on me forever. When did forever start? Oh, lets see. I guess the first day of school. We were five. You had on a red plaid dress and your hair . . . It was in two braids instead of one. My father pointed you out when we were waiting to line up, Peeta says. Your father? Why? I ask. He said, See that little girl? I wanted to marry her mother, but she ran off with a coal miner, Peeta says. What? Youre making that up! I exclaim. No, true story, Peeta says. And I said, A coal miner? Why did she want a coal miner if she couldve had you? And he said, Because when he sings . . . Even the birds stop to listen. Thats true. They do. I mean, they did, I say. Im stunned and surprisingly moved, thinking of the baker telling this to Peeta. It strikes me that my own reluctance to sing, my own dismissal of music might not really be that I think its a waste of time. It might be because it reminds me too much of my father. So that day, in music assembly, the teacher asked who knew the valley song. Your hand shot right up in the air. She stood you up on a stool and had you sing it for us. And I swear, every bird outside the windows fell silent, Peeta says. Oh, please, I say, laughing. No, it happened. And right when your song ended, I knew just like your mother I was a goner, Peeta says. Then for the next eleven years, I tried to work up the nerve to talk to you. Without success, I add. Without success. So, in a way, my name being drawn in the reaping was a real piece of luck, says Peeta. For a moment, Im almost foolishly

happy and then confusion sweeps over me. Because were supposed to be making up this stuff, playing at being in love not actually being in love. But Peetas story has a ring of truth to it. That part about my father and the birds. And I did sing the first day of school, although I dont remember the song. And that red plaid dress . . . There was one, a hand-me-down to Prim that got washed to rags after my fathers death. It would explain another thing, too. Why Peeta took a beating to give me the bread on that awful hollow day. So, if those details are true . . . Could it all be true? You have a . . . Remarkable memory, I say haltingly. I remember everything about you, says Peeta, tucking a loose strand of hair

behind my ear. Youre the one who wasnt paying attention. I am now, I say. Well, I dont have much competition here, he says. I want to draw away, to close those shutters again, but I know I cant. Its as if I can hear Haymitch whispering in my ear, Say it! Say it! I swallow hard and get the words out. You dont have much competition anywhere. And this time, its me who leans in. Our lips have just barely touched when the clunk outside makes us jump. My bow comes up, the arrow readyto fly, but theres no other sound. Peeta peers through the rocks and then gives a whoop. Before I can stop him, lies out in the rain, then handing something in to me. A silver parachute attached to a basket. I rip it open at once and inside theres a feast fresh rolls, goat cheese, apples, and best of all, a tureen of that incredible lamb stew on wild rice. The very dish I told Caesar Flickerman was the most impressive thing the Capitol had to offer. Peeta wriggles back inside, his face lit up like the sun. I guess Haymitch finally got tired of watching us starve. I guess so, I answer. But in my head I can hear Haymitchs smug, if slightly exasperated, words, Yes, thats what Im looking lot, sweetheart.

23.

Every cell in my body wants me to dig into the stew and cram it, handful by handful into my mouth. But Peetas voice stops me. We better take it slow on that stew. Remember the first night on the train? The rich food made me sick and I wasnt even starving then. Youre right. And I could just inhale the whole thing! I say

regretfully. But I dont. We are quite sensible. We each have a roll, half an apple, and an egg-size serving of stew and rice. I make myself eat the stew in tiny spoonfuls they even sent us silverware and plates savoring each bite. When we finish, I stare longingly at the dish. I want more. Me, too. Tell you what. We wait an hour, if it stays down, then we get another serving, Peeta says. Agreed, I say. Its going to be a long hour. Maybe not that long, says Peeta. What was that you were saying just before the food arrived? Something about me . . . No competition . . . Best thing that ever happened to you . . . I dont remember that last part, I say, hoping its too dim in here for the cameras to pick up my blush. Oh, thats right. Thats what I was thinking, he says. Scoot over, Im freezing. I make room for him in the sleeping bag. We lean back against the cave wall, my head on his shoulder, his arms wrapped around me. I can feel Haymitch nudging me to keep up the act. So, since we were five, you never even noticed any other girls? I ask him. No, I noticed just about every girl, but none of them made a lasting impression but you, he says. Im sure that would thrill your parents, you liking a girl from the Seam, I say. Hardly. But I couldnt care less. Anyway, if we make it back, you wont be a girl from the Seam, youll be a girl from the

Victors Village, he says. Thats right. If we win, well each get a house in the part of town reserved for Hunger Games victors. Long ago,

when the Games began, the Capitol had built a dozen fine houses in each district. Of course, in ours only one is occupied. Most of the others have never been lived in at all. A disturbing thought hits me. But then, our only neighbor will be Haymitch! Ah, thatll be nice, says Peeta, tightening his arms around me. You and me and Haymitch. Very cozy. Picnics, birthdays, long winter nights around the fire retelling old Hunger Games tales. I told you, he hates me! I say, but I cant help laughing at the image of Haymitch becoming my new pal. Only sometimes. When hes sober, Ive never heard him say one negative thing about you, says Peeta. Hes never sober! I protest. Thats right. Who am I thinking of? Oh, I know. Its Cinna who likes you. But thats mainly because you didnt try to run when he set you on fire, says Peeta. On the other hand, Haymitch . . . Well, if I were you, Id avoid Haymitch completely. He hates you. I thought you said I was his favorite, I say. He hates me more, says Peeta. I dont think people in general are his sort of thing. I know the

audience will enjoy our having fun at Haymitchs expense. He has been around so long, hes practically an old friend to some of them. And after his head-dive off the stage at the reaping, everybody knows him. By this time, theyll have dragged him out of the control room for interviews about us. No telling what sort of lies hes made up. Hes at something of a disadvantage because most mentors have a partner, another victor to help them whereas Haymitch has to be ready to go into action at any moment. Kind of like me when I was alone in the arena. I wonder how hes holding up, with the drinking, the attention, and the stress of trying to keep us alive. Its funny. Haymitch and I dont get along well in person, but maybe Peeta is right about us being alike because he seems able to communicate with me by the timing of his gifts. Like how I knew I must be close to water when he withheld it and how I knew the sleep syrup just wasnt something to ease Peetas pain and how I know now that I have to play up the romance. He hasnt made much effort to connect with Peeta really. Perhaps he thinks a bowl of broth would just be a bowl of broth to Peeta, whereas Ill see the strings attached to it. A thought hits me, and Im amazed the questions taken so long to surface. Maybe its because Ive only recently begun to view Haymitch with

a degree of curiosity. How do you think he did it? Who? Did what? Peeta asks. Haymitch. How do you think he won the Games? I say. Peeta considers this quite a while before he answers. Haymitch is sturdily built, but no physical wonder like Cato or Thresh. Hes not particularly handsome. Not in the way that causes sponsors to rain gifts on you. And hes so surly, its hard to imagine anyone teaming up with him. Theres only one way Haymitch could have won, and Peeta says it just as Im reaching this conclusion myself. He outsmarted the others, says Peeta. I nod, then let the conversation drop. But secretly

Im wondering if Haymitch sobered up long enough to help Peeta and me because he thought we just might have the wits to survive. Maybe he wasnt always a drunk. Maybe, in the beginning, he tried to help the tributes. But then it got unbearable. It must be hell to mentor two kids and then watch them die. Year after year after year. I realize that if I get out of here, that will become my job. To mentor the girl from District 12. The idea is so repellent, I thrust it from my mind. About half an hour has passed before I decide I have to eat again. Peetas too hungry himself to

put up an argument. While Im dishing up two more small servings of lamb stew and rice, we hear the anthem begin to play. Peeta presses his eyes against a crack in the rocks to watch the sky. There wont be anything to see tonight, I say, far more interested in the stew than the sky. Nothings happened or we wouldve heard a cannon. Katniss, Peeta says quietly. What? Should we split another roll, too? I ask. Katniss, he repeats, but I find myself wanting to ignore him. Im going to split one. But Ill save the cheese for tomorrow, I say. I see Peeta staring at me. What? Thresh is dead, says Peeta. He cant be, I say. They must have fired the cannon during the thunder and we missed it, says Peeta. Are you sure? I mean, its pouring buckets out there. I dont know how you can see anything, I say. I push him away from the rocks and squint out into the dark, rainy sky. For about ten seconds, I catch a distorted glimpse of Threshs picture and then hes gone. Just like that. I slump down against the rocks, momentarily forgetting about the task at hand. Thresh dead. I should be happy, right? One less tribute to face. And a powerful one, too. But Im not happy. All I can think about is Thresh letting me go, letting me run because of Rue, who died with that spear in her stomach. . . . You all right? asks Peeta. I give a noncommittal

shrug and cup my elbows in my hands, hugging them close to my body. I have to bury the real pain because whos going to bet on a tribute who keeps sniveling over the deaths of her opponents. Rue was one thing. We were allies. She was so young. But no one will understand my sorrow at Threshs murder. The word pulls me up short. Murder! Thankfully, I didnt say it aloud. Thats not going to win me any points in the arena. What I do say is, Its just . . . If we didnt win . . . I wanted Thresh to. Because he let me go. And because of Rue. Yeah, I know, says Peeta. But this means were one step closer to District Twelve. He nudges a plate of foot into my hands. Eat. Its still warm. I take a bite of the stew to show I dont really care, but its like glue in my mouth and takes a lot of effort to swallow. It also means Cato will be back hunting us. And hes got supplies again, says Peeta. Hell be wounded, I bet, I say. What makes you say that? Peeta asks. Because Thresh would have never gone down without a fight. Hes so strong, I mean, he was. And they were in his territory, I say.

Good, says Peeta. The more wounded Cato is the better. I wonder how Foxface is making out. Oh, shes fine, I say peevishly. Im still angry she thought of hiding in

the Cornucopia and I didnt. Probably be easier to catch Cato than her. Maybe theyll catch each other and we can just go home, says Peeta. But we better be extra careful about the watches. I dozed off a few times. Me, too, I admit. But not tonight. We finish our food in silence and then Peeta offers to take the first watch. I burrow down in the sleeping bag next to him, pulling my hood up over my face to hide it from the cameras. I just need a few moments of privacy where I can let any emotion cross my face without being seen. Under the hood, I silently say good-bye to Thresh and thank him for my life. I promise to remember him and, if I can, do something to help his family and Rues, if I win. Then I escape into sleep, comforted by a full belly and the steady warmth of Peeta beside me. When Peeta wakes me later, the first thing I register is the smell of goat cheese. Hes holding out half a roll spread with the creamy white stuff and topped with apple slices. Dont be mad, he says. I had to eat again. Heres your half. Oh, good, I say, immediately taking a huge bite. The strong fatty cheese tastes just like the kind Prim makes, the apples are sweet and crunchy. Mm. We make a goat cheese and apple tart at the bakery, he says. Bet thats expensive, I say. Too expensive for my family to eat. Unless its gone very stale. Of course,

practically everything we eat is stale, says Peeta, pulling the sleeping bag up around him. In less than a minute, hes snoring. Huh. I always assumed the shopkeepers live a soft life. And its true, Peeta has always had enough to eat. But theres something kind of depressing about living your life on stale bread, the hard, dry loaves that no one else wanted. One thing about us, since I bring our food home on a daily basis, most of it is so fresh you have to make sure it isnt going to make a run for it. Somewhere during my shift, the rain stops not gradually but all at once. The downpour ends and theres only the residual drippings of water from branches, the rush of the now overflowing stream below us. A full, beautiful moon emerges, and even without the glasses I can see outside. I cant decide if the moon is real or merely a projection of the Gamemakers. I know it was full shortly before I left home. Gale and I watched it rise as we hunted into the late hours. How long have I been gone? Im guessing its been about two weeks in the arena, and there was that week of preparation in the Capitol. Maybe the moon has completed its cycle. For some reason, I badly want it to be my moon, the same one I see from the woods around District 12. That would give me something to cling to in the surreal world of the arena

where the authenticity of everything is to be doubted. Four of us left. For the first time, I allow myself to truly think about the possibility that I might make it home.

To fame. To wealth. To my own house in the Victors Village. My mother and Prim would live there with me. No more fear of hunger. A new kind of freedom. But then . . . What? What would my life be like on a daily basis? Most of it has been consumed with the acquisition of food. Take that away and Im not really sure who I am, what my identity is. The idea scares me some. I think of Haymitch, with all his money. What did his life become? He lives alone, no wife or children, most of his waking hours drunk. I dont want to end up like that. But you wont be alone, I whisper to myself. I have my mother and Prim. Well, for the time being. And then . . . I dont want to think about then, when Prim has grown up, my mother passed away. I know Ill never marry, never risk bringing a child into the world. Because if theres one thing being a victor doesnt guarantee, its your childrens safety. My kids names would go right into the reaping balls with everyone elses. And I swear Ill never let that happen. The sun eventually rises, its light slipping through the cracks and illuminating Peetas face. Who will he transform into if we make it home? This perplexing, good-natured boy who can spin out lies so convincingly the whole of Panem believes him to be hopelessly in love with me, and Ill admit it, there are moments when he makes me believe it myself? At least, well be friends, I think. Nothing will change the fact that weve saved each others lives in here. And beyond that, he will always be the boy with the bread. Good friends. Anything beyond that though . . . And I feel Gales gray eyes watching me watching Peeta, all the way from District 12. Discomfort causes me to move. I scoot over and shake Peetas shoulder. His eyes open sleepily and when they focus on me, he pulls me down for a long kiss. Were wasting hunting time, I say when I finally break away. I wouldnt call it wasting, he says giving a big stretch as he sits up. So do we hunt on empty stomachs to give us an edge? Not us, I say. We stuff ourselves to give us staying power. Count me in, Peeta says. But I can see hes surprised when I divide the rest of the stew and rice and hand a heaping plate to him. All this? Well earn it back today, I say, and we both plow into our plates. Even cold, its one of the best things Ive ever tasted. I abandon my fork and scrape up the last dabs of gravy with my finger. I can feel Effie Trinket shuddering at my manners. Hey,

Effie, watch this! says Peeta. He tosses his fork over his shoulder and literally licks his plate clean with his tongue making loud, satisfied sounds. Then he blows a kiss out to her in general and calls, We miss you, Effie! I cover his mouth with my hand, but Im laughing. Stop! Cato could be right outside our cave. He grabs my hand away. What do I care? Ive got you to protect me now, says Peeta, pulling me to him. Come on, I say in exasperation, extricating myself from his grasp but not before he gets in another kiss. Once were packed up and standing

outside our cave, our mood shifts to serious. Its as though for the last few days, sheltered by the rocks and the rain and Catos preoccupation with Thresh, we were given a respite, a holiday of sorts. Now, although the day is sunny and warm, we both sense were really back in the Games. I hand Peeta my knife, since whatever weapons he once had are long gone, and he slips it into his belt. My last seven arrows of the twelve I sacrificed three in the explosion, two at the feast rattle a bit too loosely in the quiver. I cant afford to lose any more. Hell be hunting us by now, says Peeta. Cato isnt one to wait for his prey to wander by. If hes wounded I begin. It wont matter,Peeta breaks in. If he can move, hes coming. With all the rain, the stream has overrun its banks by several feet on either side. We stop there to replenish our water. I check the snares I set days ago and come up empty. Not surprising with the weather. Besides, I havent seen many animals or signs of them in this area. If we want food, we better head back up to my old hunting grounds, I say. Your call. Just tell me what you need me to do, Peeta says. Keep an eye out, I say. Stay on the rocks as much as possible, no sense in leaving him tracks to follow. And listen for both of us. Its clear, at this point, that the explosion destroyed the hearing in my left ear for good. Id walk in the water to cover our tracks completely, but Im not sure Peetas leg could take the current. Although the drugs have erased the infection, hes still pretty weak. My forehead hurts along the knife cut, but after three days the bleeding has stopped. I wear a bandage around my head though, just in case physical exertion should bring it back. As we head up alongside the stream, we pass the place where I found Peeta camouflaged in the weeds and mud. One good thing, between the downpour and the flooded banks, all signs of his hiding place have been wiped out. That means that, if need be, we can come back to our cave. Otherwise, I wouldnt risk

it with Cato after us. The boulders diminish to rocks that eventually turn to pebbles, and then, to my relief, were back on pine needles and the gentle incline of the forest floor. For the first time, I realize we have a problem. Navigating the rocky terrain with a bad leg well, youre naturally going to make some noise. But even on the smooth bed of needles, Peeta is loud. And I mean loud loud, as if hes stomping his feet or something. I turn and look at him. What? he asks. Youve got to move more quietly, I say. Forget about Cato, youre chasing off every rabbit in a ten-mile radius. Really? he says. Sorry, I didnt know. So, we start up again and hes a tiny bit better, but even with only one working ear, hes making me jump. Can you take your boots off? I suggest. Here? he asks in disbelief, as if Id asked him to walk barefoot on hot coals or something. I have to remind myself that hes still not used to the woods, that its the scary, forbidden place beyond the fences of

District 12. I think of Gale, with his velvet tread. Its eerie how little sound he makes, even when the leaves have fallen and its a challenge to move at all without chasing off the game. I feel certain hes laughing back home. Yes, I say patiently. I will, too. That way well both be quieter. Like I was making any noise. So we both strip off our boots and socks and, while theres some improvement, I could swear hes making an effort to snap every branch we encounter. Needless to say, although it takes several hours to reach my old camp with Rue, Ive shot nothing. If the stream would settle down, fish might be an option, but the current is still too strong. As we stop to rest and drink water, I try to work out a solution. Ideally, Id dump Peeta now with some simple root-gathering chore and go hunt, but then hed be left with only a knife to defend himself against Catos spears and superior strength. So what Id really like is to try and conceal him somewhere safe, then go hunt, and come back and collect him. But I have a feeling his ego isnt going to go for that suggestion. Katniss, he says. We need to split up. I know Im chasing away the game. Only because your legs hurt, I say generously, because really, you can tell thats only a small part of the problem. I know, he says. So, why dont you go on? Show me some plants to gather and that way well both be useful. Not if Cato comes and kills you. I tried to say it in a nice way, but it still sounds like I think hes a weakling. Surprisingly, he just laughs. Look, I can handle Cato. I fought him before, didnt I? Yeah, and that turned

out great. You ended up dying in a mud bank. Thats what I want to say, but I cant. He did save my life by taking on Cato after all. I try another tactic. What if you climbed up in a tree and acted as a lookout while I hunted? I say, trying to make it sound like very important work. What if you show me whats edible around here and go get us some meat? he says, mimicking my tone. Just dont go far, in case you need help. I sigh and show him some roots to dig. We do need food, no question. One apple, two rolls, and a blob of cheese the size of a plum wont last long. Ill just go a short distance and hope Cato is a long way off. I teach him a bird whistle not a melody like Rues but a simple two-note whistle which we can use to communicate that were all right. Fortunately, hes good at this. Leaving him with the pack, I head off. I feel like Im eleven again, tethered not to the safety of the fence but to Peeta, allowing myself twenty, maybe thirty yards of hunting space. Away from him though, the woods come alive with animal sounds. Reassured by his periodic whistles, I allow myself to drift farther away, and soon have two rabbits and a fat squirrel to show for it. I decide its enough. I can set snares and maybe get some fish. With Peetas roots, this will be enough for now. As I travel the short distance back, I realize we havent

exchanged signals in a while. When my whistle receives no

response, I run. In no time, I find the pack, a neat pile of roots beside it. The sheet of plastic has been laid on the ground where the sun can reach the single layer of berries that covers it. But where is he? Peeta! I call out in a panic. Peeta! I turn to the rustle of brush and almost send an arrow through him. Fortunately, I pull my bow at the last second and it sticks in an oak trunk to his left. He jumps back, flinging a handful of berries into the foliage. My fear comes out as anger. What are you doing? Youre supposed to be here, not running around in the woods! I found some berries down by the stream, he says, clearly confused by my outburst. I whistled. Why didnt you whistle back? I snap at him. I didnt hear. The waters too loud, I guess, he says. He crosses and puts his hands on my shoulders. Thats when I feel that Im trembling. I thought Cato killed you! I almost shout. No, Im fine. Peeta wraps his arms around me, but I dont respond. Katniss? I push away, trying to sort out my feelings. If two people agree on a signal, they stay in range. Because if one of them doesnt answer, theyre in trouble, all right? All right! he says. All right. Because thats what happened with Rue,

and I watched her die! I say. I turn away from him, go to the pack and open a fresh bottle of water, although I still have some in mine. But Im not ready to forgive him. I notice the food. The rolls and apples are untouched, but someones definitely picked away part of the cheese. And you ate without me! I really dont care, I just want something else to be mad about. What? No, I didnt, Peeta says. Oh, and I suppose the apples ate the cheese, I say. I dont know what ate the cheese, Peeta says slowly and distinctly, as if trying not to lose his temper, but it wasnt me. Ive been down by the stream collecting berries. Would you care for some? I would actually, but I dont want to relent too soon. I do walk over and look at them. Ive never seen this type before. No, I have. But not in the arena. These arent Rues berries, although they resemble them. Nor do they match any I learned about in training. I lean down and scoop up a few, rolling them between my fingers. My fathers voice comes back to me. Not these, Katniss. Never these. Theyre nightlock. Youll be dead before they reach your stomach. Just then, the cannon fires. I whip around, expecting Peeta to collapse to the ground, but he only raises his eyebrows. The hovercraft appears a hundred yards or so away. Whats left of Foxfaces emaciated body is lifted into the air.

I can see the red glint of her hair in the sunlight. I should have known the moment I saw the missing cheese. . . . Peeta has me by the arm, pushing me toward a tree. Climb. Hell be here in a second. Well stand a better chance fighting him from above. I stop him, suddenly calm. No, Peeta, shes your kill, not Catos. What? I havent even seen her since the first day, he says. How could I have killed her? In answer, I hold out the berries.

24.

It takes a while to

explain the situation to Peeta. How Foxface stole the food from the supply pile before I blew it up, how she tried to take enough to stay alive but not enough that anyone would notice it, how she wouldnt question the safety of berries we were preparing to eat ourselves. I wonder how she found us, says Peeta. My fault, I guess, if Im as loud as you say. We were about as hard to follow as a herd of cattle, but I try

to be kind. And shes very clever, Peeta. Well, she was. Until you outfoxed her. Not on purpose. Doesnt seem fair somehow. I mean, we would have both been dead, too, if she hadnt eaten the berries first. He checks himself. No, of course, we wouldnt. You recognized them, didnt you? I give a nod. We call them nightlock. Even the name sounds deadly, he says. Im sorry, Katniss. I really thought they were the same ones youd gathered. Dont apologize. It just means were one step closer to home, right? I ask. Ill get rid of the rest, Peeta says. He gathers up the sheet of blue plastic, careful to trap the berries inside, and goes to toss them into the woods. Wait! I cry. I find the leather pouch that belonged to the boy from District 1 and fill it with a few handfuls of berries from the plastic. If they fooled Foxface, maybe they can fool Cato as well. If hes chasing us or something, we can act like we accidentally drop the pouch and if he eats them Then hello District Twelve, says Peeta. Thats it, I say, securing the pouch to my belt. Hell know where we are now, says Peeta. If he was anywhere nearby and saw that hovercraft, hell know we killed her and come after us. Peetas right. This could be just the opportunity Catos been waiting for. But even if we run now, theres the meat to cook and our fire will be another sign of our whereabouts. Lets make a fire. Right

now. I begin to gather branches and brush. Are you ready to face him? Peeta asks. Im ready to eat. Better to cook our food while we have the chance. If he knows were here, he knows. But he also knows theres two of us and probably assumes we were hunting Foxface. That means youre recovered. And the fire means were not hiding, were inviting him here. Would you show up? I ask. Maybe not, he says. Peetas a whiz with fires, coaxing a blaze out of the damp wood. In no time, I have the rabbits and squirrel roasting, the roots, wrapped in leaves, baking in the coals. We take turns gathering greens and keeping a careful watch for Cato, but as I anticipated, he doesnt make an appearance. When the foods cooked, I pack most of it up, leaving us each a rabbits leg to eat as we walk. I want to move higher into the woods, climb a good tree, and make camp for the night, but Peeta resists. I cant climb like you, Katniss, especially with my leg, and I dont think I could ever fall asleep fifty feet above the ground. Its not safe to stay in the open, Peeta, I say. Cant we go back to the cave? he asks. Its near water and easy to defend. I sigh. Several more hours of walking or should I say crashing through


the woods to reach an area well just have to leave in the morning to hunt. But Peeta doesnt ask for much. Hes followed my instructions all day and Im sure if things were reversed, he wouldnt make me spend the night in a tree. It dawns on me that I havent been very nice to Peeta today. Nagging him about how loud he was, screaming at him over disappearing. The playful romance we had sustained in the cave has disappeared out in the open, under the hot sun, with the threat of Cato looming over us. Haymitch has probably just about had it with me. And as for the audience . . . I reach up and give him a kiss. Sure. Lets go back to the cave. He looks pleased and relieved. Well, that was easy. I work my arrow out of the oak, careful not to damage the shaft. These arrows are food, safety, and life itself now. We toss a bunch more wood on the fire. It should be sending off smoke for a few more hours, although I doubt Cato assumes anything at this point. When we reach the stream, I see the water has dropped considerably and moves at its old leisurely pace, so I suggest we walk back in it. Peetas happy to oblige and since hes a lot quieter in water than on land, its a doubly good idea. Its a long walk back to the cave though, even going downward, even with the rabbit to give us a boost. Were both exhausted by our

hike today and still way too underfed. I keep my bow loaded, both for Cato and any fish I might see, but the stream seems strangely empty of creatures. By the time we reach our destination, our feet are dragging and the sun sits low on the horizon. We fill up our water bottles and climb the little slope to our den. Its not much, but out here in the wilderness, its the closest thing we have to a home. It will be warmer than a tree, too, because it provides some shelter from the wind that has begun to blow steadily in from the west. I set a good dinner out, but halfway through Peeta begins to nod off. After days of inactivity, the hunt has taken its toll. I order him into the sleeping bag and set aside the rest of his food for when he wakes. He drops off immediately. I pull the sleeping bag up to his chin and kiss his forehead, not for the audience, but for me. Because Im so grateful that hes still here, not dead by the stream as Id thought. So glad that I dont have to face Cato alone. Brutal, bloody Cato who can snap a neck with a twist of his arm, who had the power to overcome Thresh, who has had it out for me since the beginning. He probably has had a special hatred for me ever since I outscored him in training. A boy like Peeta would simply shrug that off. But I have a feeling it drove Cato to distraction. Which is not that hard. I

think of his ridiculous reaction to finding the supplies blown up. The others were upset, of course, but he was completely unhinged. I wonder now if Cato might not be entirely sane. The sky lights up with the seal, and I watch Foxface shine in the sky and then disappear from the world forever. He hasnt said it, but I

dont think Peeta felt good about killing her, even if it was essential. I cant pretend Ill miss her, but I have to admire her. My guess is if they had given us some sort of test, she would have been the smartest of all the tributes. If, in fact, we had been setting a trap for her, I bet shed have sensed it and avoided the berries. It was Peetas own ignorance that brought her down. Ive spent so much time making sure I dont underestimate my opponents that Ive forgotten its just as dangerous to overestimate them as well. That brings me back to Cato. But while I think I had a sense of Foxface, who she was and how she operated, hes a little more slippery. Powerful, well trained, but smart? I dont know. Not like she was. And utterly lacking in the control Foxface demonstrated. I believe Cato could easily lose his judgment in a fit of temper. Not that I can feel superior on that point. I think of the moment I sent the arrow flying into the apple in the pigs mouth when I was so enraged. Maybe I do understand Cato better than I think. Despite the fatigue in my body, my minds alert, so I let Peeta sleep long past our usual switch. In fact, a soft gray day has begun when I shake his shoulder. He looks out, almost in alarm. I slept the whole night. Thats not fair, Katniss, you should have woken me. I stretch and burrow down into the bag. Ill sleep now. Wake me if anything interesting happens. Apparently nothing does, because when I open my eyes, bright hot afternoon light gleams through the rocks. Any sign of our friend? I ask. Peeta shakes his head. No, hes keeping a disturbingly low profile. How long do you think well have before the Gamemakers drive us together? I ask. Well, Foxface died almost a day ago, so theres been plenty of time for the audience to place bets and get bored. I guess it could happen at any moment, says Peeta. Yeah, I have a feeling todays the day, I say. I sit up and look out at the peaceful terrain. I wonder how theyll do it. Peeta remains silent. Theres not really any good answer. Well, until they do, no sense in wasting a hunting day. But we should probably eat as much as we can hold just in case we run into trouble, I say. Peeta packs up our gear while I lay out a big meal. The rest of the rabbits, roots,

greens, the rolls spread with the last bit of cheese. The only thing I leave in reserve is the squirrel and the apple. By the time were done, all thats left is a pile of rabbit bones. My hands are greasy, which only adds to my growing feeling of grubbiness. Maybe we dont bathe daily in the Seam, but we keep cleaner than I have of late. Except for my feet, which have walked in the stream, Im covered in a layer of grime. Leaving the cave has a sense of finality about it. I dont think there will be another night in the arena somehow. One way or the other, dead or alive, I have the feeling Ill escape it today. I give the rocks a pat good-bye and we head down to the stream to wash up. I can feel my skin, itching for the cool water. I

may do my hair and braid it back wet. Im wondering if we might even be able to give our clothes a quick scrub when we reach the stream. Or what used to be the stream. Now theres only a bone-dry bed. I put my hand down to feel it. Not even a little damp. They must have drained it while we slept, I say. A fear of the cracked tongue, aching body and fuzzy mind brought on by my previous dehydration creeps into my consciousness. Our bottles and skin are fairly full, but with two drinking and this hot sun it wont take long to deplete them. The lake, says Peeta. Thats where they want us to go. Maybe the ponds still have some, I say hopefully. We can check, he says, but hes just humoring me. Im humoring myself because I know what Ill find when we return to the pond where I soaked my leg. A dusty, gaping mouth of a hole. But we make the trip anyway just to confirm what we already know. Youre right. Theyre driving us to the lake, I say. Where theres no cover. Where theyre guaranteed a bloody fight to the death with nothing to block their view. Do you want to go straightaway or wait until the waters tapped out? Lets go now, while weve had food and rest. Lets just go end this thing, he says. I nod. Its funny. I feel almost as if its the first day of the Games again. That Im in the same position. Twenty-one tributes are dead, but I still have yet to kill Cato. And really, wasnt he always the one to kill? Now it seems the other tributes were just minor obstacles, distractions, keeping us from the real battle of the Games. Cato and me. But no, theres the boy waiting beside me. I feel his arms wrap around me. Two against one. Should be a piece of cake, he says. Next time we eat, it will be in the Capitol, I answer. You bet it will, he says. We stand there a while, locked in an embrace, feeling each other, the sunlight, the rustle of the

leaves at our feet. Then without a word, we break apart and head for the lake. I dont care now that Peetas footfalls send rodents scurrying, make birds take wing. We have to fight Cato and Id just as soon do it here as on the plain. But I doubt Ill have that choice. If the Gamemakers want us in the open, then in the open we will be. We stop to rest for a few moments under the tree where the Careers trapped me. The husk of the tracker jacker nest, beaten to a pulp by the heavy rains and dried in the burning sun, confirms the location. I touch it with the tip of my boot, and it dissolves into dust that is quickly carried off by the breeze. I cant help looking up in the tree where Rue secretly perched, waiting to save my life. Tracker jackers. Glimmers bloated body. The terrifying hallucinations . . . Lets move on, I say, wanting to escape the darkness that surrounds this place. Peeta doesnt object. Given our late start to the day, when we reach the plain its already early evening. Theres no sign of Cato. No sign of anything except the gold Cornucopia glowing in the slanting sun rays. Just in case Cato decided to pull a Foxface on

us, we circle the Cornucopia to make sure its empty. Then obediently, as if following instructions, we cross to the lake and fill our water containers. I frown at the shrinking sun. We dont want to fight him after dark. Theres only the one pair of glasses. Peeta carefully squeezes drops of iodine into the water. Maybe thats what hes waiting for. What do you want to do? Go back to the cave? Either that or find a tree. But lets give him another half an hour or so. Then well take cover, I answer. We sit by the lake, in full sight. Theres no point in hiding now. In the trees at the edge of the plain, I can see the mockingjays flitting about. Bouncing melodies back and forth between them like brightly colored balls. I open my mouth and sing out Rues four-note run. I can feel them pause curiously at the sound of my voice, listening for more. I repeat the notes in the silence. First one mockingjay trills the tune back, then another. Then the whole world comes alive with the sound. Just like your father, says Peeta. My fingers find the pin on my shirt. Thats Rues song, I say. I think they remember it. The music swells and I recognize the brilliance of it. As the notes overlap, they compliment one another, forming a lovely, unearthly harmony. It was this sound then, thanks to Rue, that sent the orchard workers of District 11 home each night. Does someone start it at quitting time, I wonder, now that she is dead?

For a while, I just close my eyes and listen, mesmerized by the beauty of the song. Then something begins to disrupt the music. Runs cut off in jagged, imperfect lines. Dissonant notes intersperse with the melody. The mockingjays voices rise up in a shrieking cry of alarm. Were on our feet, Peeta wielding his knife, me poised to shoot, when Cato smashes through the trees and bears down on us. He has no spear. In fact, his hands are empty, yet he runs straight for us. My first arrow hits his chest and inexplicably falls aside. Hes got some kind of body armor! I shout to Peeta. Just in time, too, because Cato is upon us. I brace myself, but he rockets right between us with no attempt to check his speed. I can tell from his panting, the sweat pouring off his purplish face, that hes been running hard a long time. Not toward us. From something. But what? My eyes scan the woods just in time to see the first creature leap onto the plain. As Im turning away, I see another half dozen join it. Then I am stumbling blindly after Cato with no thought of anything but to save myself.

25.Muttations. No question about it. Ive never seen these mutts, but theyre no natural-born animals. They resemble huge wolves, but what wolf lands and then balances easily on its hind legs? What wolf waves the rest of the pack forward with its front paw as though it had a wrist? These things I can see at a distance. Up close, Im sure their more menacing attributes will be revealed. Cato has made a beeline for the Cornucopia, and without question I follow him. If he thinks its the

safest place, who am I to argue? Besides, even if I could make it to the trees, it would be impossible for Peeta to outrun them on that leg Peeta! My hands have just landed on the metal at the pointed tail of the Cornucopia when I remember Im part of a team. Hes about fifteen yards behind me, hobbling as fast as he can, but the mutts are closing in on him fast. I send an arrow into the pack and one goes down, but there are plenty to take its place. Peetas waving me up the horn, Go, Katniss! Go! Hes right. I cant protect either of us on the ground. I start climbing, scaling the Cornucopia on my hands and feet. The pure gold surface has been designed to resemble the woven horn that we fill at harvest, so there are little ridges and seams to get a decent hold

on. But after a day in the arena sun, the metal feels hot enough to blister my hands. Cato lies on his side at the very top of the horn, twenty feet above the ground, gasping to catch his breath as he gags over the edge. Nows my chance to finish him off. I stop midway up the horn and load another arrow, but just as Im about to let it fly, I hear Peeta cry out. I twist around and see hes just reached the tail, and the mutts are right on his heels. Climb! I yell. Peeta starts up hampered by not only the leg but the knife in his hand. I shoot my arrow down the throat of the first mutt that places its paws on the metal. As it dies the creature lashes out, inadvertently opening gashes on a few of its companions. Thats when I get a look at the claws. Four inches and clearly razor-sharp. Peeta reaches my feet and I grab his arm and pull him along. Then I remember Cato waiting at the top and whip around, but hes doubled over with cramps and apparently more preoccupied with the mutts than us. He coughs out something unintelligible. The snuffling, growling sound coming from the mutts isnt helping. What? I shout at him. He said, Can they climb it? answers Peeta, drawing my focus back to the base of the horn. The mutts are beginning to assemble. As they join together, they raise up again to stand easily on their back legs giving them an eerily

human quality. Each has a thick coat, some with fur that is straight and sleek, others curly, and the colors vary from jet black to what I can only describe as blond. Theres something else about them, something that makes the hair rise up on the back of my neck, but I cant put my finger on it. They put their snouts on the horn, sniffing and tasting the metal, scraping paws over the surface and then making high-pitched yipping sounds to one another. This must be how they communicate because the pack backs up as if to make room. Then one of them, a good-size mutt with silky waves of blond fur takes a running start and leaps onto the horn. Its back legs must be incredibly powerful because it lands a mere ten feet below us, its pink lips pulled back in a snarl. For a moment it hangs there, and in that moment I realize what else unsettled me about the mutts. The green

eyes glowering at me are unlike any dog or wolf, any canine Ive ever seen. They are unmistakably human. And that revelation has barely registered when I notice the collar with the number 1 inlaid with jewels and the whole horrible thing hits me. The blonde hair, the green eyes, the number . . . Its Glimmer. A shriek escapes my lips

and Im having trouble holding the arrow in place. I have been waiting to fire, only too aware of my dwindling supply of arrows. Waiting to see if the creatures can, in fact, climb. But now, even though the mutt has begun to slide backward, unable to find any purchase on the metal, even though I can hear the slow screeching of the claws like nails on a blackboard, I fire into its throat. Its body twitches and flops onto the ground with a thud. Katniss? I can feel Peetas grip on my arm. Its her! I get out. Who? asks Peeta. My head snaps from side to side as I examine the pack, taking in the various sizes and colors. The small one with the red coat and amber eyes . . . Foxface! And there, the ashen hair and hazel eyes of the boy from District 9 who died as we struggled for the backpack! And worst of all, the smallest mutt, with dark glossy fur, huge brown eyes and a collar that reads 11 in woven straw. Teeth bared in hatred. Rue . . . What is it, Katniss? Peeta shakes my shoulder. Its them. Its all of them. The others. Rue and Foxface and . . . All of the other tributes, I choke out. I hear Peetas gasp of recognition. What did they do to them? You dont think . . . Those could be their real eyes? Their eyes are the least of my worries. What about their brains? Have they been given any of the real tributes memories ? Have they been programmed to hate our faces particularly because we have survived and they were so callously murdered? And the ones we actually killed . . . Do they believe theyre avenging their own deaths? Before I can get this out, the mutts begin a new assault on the horn. Theyve split into two groups at the sides of the horn and are using those powerful hindquarters to launch themselves at us. A pair of teeth ring together just inches from my hand and then I hear Peeta cry out, feel the yank on his body, the heavy weight of boy and mutt pulling me over the side. If not for the grip on my arm, hed be on the ground, but as it is, it takes all my strength to keep us both on the curved back of the horn. And more tributes are coming. Kill it, Peeta! Kill it! Im shouting, and although I cant quite see whats happening, I know he must have stabbed the thing because the pull lessens. Im able to haul him back onto the horn where we drag ourselves toward the top where the lesser of two evils awaits. Cato has still not regained his feet, but his breathing is slowing and I know soon hell be recovered enough to come for us, to hurl us over the side to our deaths. I arm my bow, but the arrow ends up taking out a mutt that can only be Thresh. Who else could jump so high? I feel a moments relief because we must finally be


up above the mutt line and Im just turning back to face Cato when Peetas jerked from my side. Im sure the pack has got him until his blood splatters my face. Cato stands before me, almost at the lip of the horn, holding Peeta in some kind of headlock, cutting off his air. Peetas clawing at Catos arm, but weakly, as if confused over whether its more important to breathe or try and stem the gush of blood from the gaping hole a mutt left in his calf. I aim one of my last two arrows at Catos head, knowing itll have no effect on his trunk or limbs, which I can now see are clothed in a skintight, flesh-colored mesh. Some high-grade body armor from the Capitol. Was that what was in his pack at the feast? Body armor to defend against my arrows? Well, they neglected to send a face guard. Cato just laughs. Shoot me and he goes down with me. Hes right. If I take him out and he falls to the mutts, Peeta is sure to die with him. Weve reached a stalemate. I cant shoot Cato without killing Peeta, too. He cant kill Peeta without guaranteeing an arrow in his brain. We stand like statues, both of us seeking an out. My muscles are strained so tightly, they feel they might snap at any moment. My teeth clenched to the breaking point. The mutts go silent and the only thing I can hear is the blood pounding in my good ear. Peetas lips are turning blue. If

I dont do something quickly, hell die of asphyxiation and then Ill have lost him and Cato will probably use his body as a weapon against me. In fact, Im sure this is Catos plan because while hes stopped laughing, his lips are set in a triumphant smile. As if in a last-ditch effort, Peeta raises his fingers, dripping with blood from his leg, up to Catos arm. Instead of trying to wrestle his way free, his forefinger veers off and makes a deliberate X on the back of Catos hand. Cato realizes what it means exactly one second after I do. I can tell by the way the smile drops from his lips. But its one second too late because, by that time, my arrow is piercing his hand. He cries out and reflexively releases Peeta who slams back against him. For a horrible moment, I think theyre both going over. I dive forward just catching hold of Peeta as Cato loses his footing on the blood-slick horn and pluminets to the ground. We hear him hit, the air leaving his body on impact, and then the mutts attack him. Peeta and I hold on to each other, waiting for the cannon, waiting for the competition to finish, waiting to be released. But it doesnt happen. Not yet. Because this is the climax of the Hunger Games, and the audience expects a show. I dont watch, but I can hear the snarls, the growls, the howls of pain from both human and beast as Cato takes on the mutt pack.

I cant understand how he can be surviving until I remember the body armor protecting him from ankle to neck and I realize what a long night this could be. Cato must have a knife or sword or something, too, something he had hidden in his clothes, because on occasion theres the

death scream of a mutt or the sound of metal on metal as the blade collides with the golden horn. The combat moves around the side of the Cornucopia, and I know Cato must be attempting the one maneuver that could save his life to make his way back around to the tail of the horn and rejoin us. But in the end, despite his remarkable strength and skill, he is simply overpowered. I dont know how long it has been, maybe an hour or so, when Cato hits the ground and we hear the mutts dragging him, dragging him back into the Cornucopia. Now theyll finish him off, I think. But theres still no cannon. Night falls and the anthem plays and theres no picture of Cato in the sky, only the faint moans coming through the metal beneath us. The icy air blowing across the plain reminds me that the Games are not over and may not be for who knows how long, and there is still no guarantee of victory. I turn my

attention to Peeta and discover his leg is bleeding as badly as ever. All our supplies, our packs, remain down by the lake where we abandoned them when we fled from the mutts. I have no bandage, nothing to staunch the flow of blood from his calf. Although Im shaking in the biting wind, I rip off my jacket, remove my shirt, and zip back into the jacket as swiftly as possible. That brief exposure sets my teeth chattering beyond control. Peetas face is gray in the pale moonlight. I make him lie down before I probe his wound. Warm, slippery blood runs over my fingers. A bandage will not be enough. Ive seen my mother tie a tourniquet a handful of times and try to replicate it. I cut free a sleeve from my shirt, wrap it twice around his leg just under his knee, and tie a half knot. I dont have a stick, so I take my remaining arrow and insert it in the knot, twisting it as tightly as I dare. Its risky business Peeta may end up losing his leg but when I weigh this against him losing his life, what alternative do I have? I bandage the wound in the rest of my shirt and lay down with him. Dont go to sleep, I tell him. Im not sure if this is exactly medical protocol, but Im terrified that if he drifts off hell never wake again. Are you cold? he asks. He unzips his jacket and I press against him as he fastens it around me. Its a bit warmer, sharing

our body heat inside my double layer of jackets, but the night is young. The temperature will continue to drop. Even now I can feel the Cornucopia, which burned so when I first climbed it, slowly turning to ice. Cato may win this thing yet, I whisper to Peeta. Dont you believe it, he says, pulling up my hood, but hes shaking harder than I am. The next hours are the worst in my life, which if you think about it, is saying something. The cold would be torture enough, but the real nightmare is listening to Cato, moaning, begging, and finally just whimpering as the mutts work away at him. After a very short time, I dont care who he is or what hes done, all I want is for his suffering to end. Why dont they just kill him? I ask Peeta.

You know why, he says, and pulls me closer to him. And I do. No viewer could turn away from the show now. From the Gamemakers point of view, this is the final word in entertainment. It goes on and on and on and eventually completely consumes my mind, blocking out memories and hopes of tomorrow, erasing everything but the present, which I begin to believe will never change. There will never be anything but cold and fear and the agonized sounds of the boy dying in the

horn. Peeta begins to doze off now, and each time he does, I find myself yelling his name louder and louder because if he goes and dies on me now, I know Ill go completely insane. Hes fighting it, probably more for me than for him, and its hard because unconsciousness would be its own form of escape. But the adrenaline pumping through my body would never allow me to follow him, so I cant let him go. I just cant. The only indication of the passage of time lies in the heavens, the subtle shift of the moon. So Peeta begins pointing it out to me, insisting I acknowledge its progress and sometimes, for just a moment I feel a flicker of hope before the agony of the night engulfs me again. Finally, I hear him whisper that the sun is rising. I open my eyes and find the stars fading in the pale light of dawn. I can see, too, how bloodless Peetas face has become. How little time he has left. And I know I have to get him back to the Capitol. Still, no cannon has fired. I press my good ear against the horn and can just make out Catos voice. I think hes closer now. Katniss, can you shoot him? Peeta asks. If hes near the mouth, I may be able to take him out. It would be an act of mercy at this point. My last arrows in your tourniquet, I say. Make it count, says Peeta, unzipping his jacket, letting me loose. So I free the arrow, tying the

tourniquet back as tightly as my frozen fingers can manage. I rub my hands together, trying to regain circulation. When I crawl to the lip of the horn and hang over the edge, I feel Peetas hands grip me for support. It takes a few moments to find Cato in the dim light, in the blood. Then the raw hunk of meat that used to be my enemy makes a sound, and I know where his mouth is. And I think the word hes trying to say is please. Pity, not vengeance, sends my arrow flying into his skull. Peeta pulls me back up, bow in hand, quiver empty. Did you get him? he whispers. The cannon fires in answer. Then we won, Katniss, he says hollowly. Hurray for us, I get out, but theres no joy of victory in my voice. A hole opens in the plain and as if on cue, the remaining mutts bound into it, disappearing as the earth closes above them. We wait, for the hovercraft to take Catos remains, for the trumpets of victory that should follow, but nothing happens. Hey! I shout into air. Whats going on? The only response is the chatter of waking birds. Maybe its the body. Maybe we have to move away from it, says Peeta. I try to remember. Do you have to distance yourself from the dead tribute


on the final kill? My brain is too muddled to be sure, but what else could be the reason for the delay? Okay. Think you could make it to the lake? I ask. Think I better try, says Peeta. We inch down to the tail of the horn and fall to the ground. If the stiffness in my limbs is this bad, how can Peeta even move? I rise first, swinging and bending my arms and legs until I think I can help him up. Somehow, we make it back to the lake. I scoop up a handful of the cold water for Peeta and bring a second to my lips. A mockingjay gives the long, low whistle, and tears of relief fill my eyes as the hovercraft appears and takes Catos body away. Now they will take us. Now we can go home. But again theres no response. What are they waiting for? says Peeta weakly. Between the loss of the tourniquet and the effort it took to get to the lake, his wound has opened up again. I dont know, I say. Whatever the holdup is, I cant watch him lose any more blood. I get up to find a stick but almost immediately come across the arrow that bounced off Catos body armor. It will do as well as the other arrow. As I stoop to pick it up, Claudius Templesmiths voice booms into the arena. Greetings to the final contestants of the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games. The earlier revision has been revoked. Closer examination of the rule book has disclosed that only one

winner may be allowed, he says. Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor. Theres a small burst of static and then nothing more. I stare at Peeta in disbelief as the truth sinks in. They never intended to let us both live. This has all been devised by the Gamemakers to guarantee the most dramatic showdown in history. And like a fool, I bought into it. If you think about it, its not that surprising, he says softly. I watch as he painfully makes it to his feet. Then hes moving toward me, as if in slow motion, his hand is pulling the knife from his belt Before I am even aware of my actions, my bow is loaded with the arrow pointed straight at his heart. Peeta raises his eyebrows and I see the knife has already left his hand on its way to the lake where it splashes in the water. I drop my weapons and take a step back, my face burning in what can only be shame. No, he says. Do it. Peeta limps toward me and thrusts the weapons back in my hands. I cant, I say. I wont. Do it. Before they send those mutts back or something. I dont want to die like Cato, he says. Then you shoot me, I say furiously, shoving the weapons back at him. You shoot me and go home and live with it! And as I say it, I know death right here, right now would be the easier of the two. You know I cant, Peeta says, discarding the weapons. Fine, Ill go

first anyway. He leans down and rips the bandage off his leg, eliminating the final barrier between his blood and the earth. No, you cant kill yourself, I say. Im on my knees, desperately plastering the bandage back onto his wound. Katniss, he says. Its what I want. Youre not leaving me here alone, I say.

Because if he dies, Ill never go home, not really. Ill spend the rest of my life in this arena trying to think my way out. Listen, he says pulling me to my feet. We both know they have to have a victor. It can only be one of us. Please, take it. For me. And he goes on about how he loves me, what life would be without me but Ive stopped listening because his previous words are trapped in my head, thrashing desperately around. We both know they have to have a victor. Yes, they have to have a victor. Without a victor, the whole thing would blow up in the Gamemakers faces. Theyd have failed the Capitol. Might possibly even be executed, slowly and painfully while the cameras broadcast it to every screen in the country. If Peeta and I were both to die, or they thought we were . . . My fingers fumble with the pouch on my belt, freeing it. Peeta sees it and his hand clamps on my wrist. No, I wont let you. Trust me, I

whisper. He holds my gaze for a long moment then lets me go. I loosen the top of the pouch and pour a few spoonfuls of berries into his palm. Then I fill my own. On the count of three? Peeta leans down and kisses me once, very gently. The count of three, he says. We stand, our backs pressed together, our empty hands locked tight. Hold them out. I want everyone to see, he says. I spread out my fingers, and the dark berries glisten in the sun. I give Peetas hand one last squeeze as a signal, as a good-bye, and we begin counting. One. Maybe Im wrong. Two. Maybe they dont care if we both die. Three! Its too late to change my mind. I lift my hand to my mouth, taking one last look at the world. The berries have just passed my lips when the trumpets begin to blare. The frantic voice of Claudius Templesmith shouts above them. Stop! Stop! Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to present the victors of the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark! I give you the tributes of District Twelve!

26.

I spew the berries from my mouth, wiping my tongue with the end of my shirt to make sure no juice remains. Peeta pulls me to the lake where we both flush our mouths with water and then collapse into each others arms. You didnt swallow any? I ask him. He shakes his head. You? Guess Id be dead by now if I did, I say. I can see his lips moving in reply, but I cant hear him over the roar of the crowd in the Capitol that theyre playing live over the speakers. The hovercraft materializes overhead and two ladders drop, only theres no way Im letting go of Peeta. I keep one arm around him as I help him up, and we each place a foot on the first rung of the ladder. The electric current freezes us in place, and this time Im glad because Im not really sure Peeta can hang on for the whole ride. And since my eyes were looking down, I can see that while our muscles are immobile, nothing is preventing the blood from draining out of Peetas leg. Sure enough, the minute the door closes behind us and the current stops, he slumps to the floor unconscious. My fingers are

still gripping the back of his jacket so tightly that when they take him away it tears leaving me with a fistful of black fabric. Doctors in sterile white, masked and

gloved, already prepped to operate, go into action. Peetas so pale and still on a silver table, tubes and wires springing out of him every which way, and for a moment I forget were out of the Games and I see the doctors as just one more threat, one more pack of mutts designed to kill him. Petrified, I lunge for him, but Im caught and thrust back into another room, and a glass door seals between us. I pound on the glass, screaming my head off. Everyone ignores me except for some Capitol attendant who appears behind me and offers me a beverage. I slump down on the floor, my face against the door, staring uncomprehendingly at the crystal glass in my hand. Icy cold, filled with orange juice, a straw with a frilly white collar. How wrong it looks in my bloody, filthy hand with its dirt-caked nails and scars. My mouth waters at the smell, but I place it carefully on the floor, not trusting anything so clean and pretty. Through the glass, I see the doctors working feverishly on Peeta, their brows creased in concentration. I see the flow of liquids, pumping through the tubes, watch a wall of dials and lights that mean nothing to me. Im not sure, but I think his heart stops twice. Its like being home again, when they bring in the hopelessly mangled person from the mine explosion, or the woman in her third day of labor, or the famished

child struggling against pneumonia and my mother and Prim, they wear that same look on their faces. Now is the time to run away to the woods, to hide in the trees until the patient is long gone and in another part of the Seam the hammers make the coffin. But Im held here both by the hovercraft walls and the same force that holds the loved ones of the dying. How often Ive seen them, ringed around our kitchen table and I thought, Why dont they leave? Why do they stay to watch? And now I know. Its because you have no choice. I startle when I catch someone staring at me from only a few inches away and then realize its my own face reflecting back in the glass. Wild eyes, hollow cheeks, my hair in a tangled mat. Rabid. Feral. Mad. No wonder everyone is keeping a safe distance from me. The next thing I know weve landed back on the roof of the Training Center and theyre taking Peeta but leaving me behind the door. I start hurling myself against the glass, shrieking and I think I just catch a glimpse of pink hair it must be Effie, it has to be Effie coming to my rescue when the needle jabs me from behind. When I wake, Im afraid to move at first. The entire ceiling glows with a soft yellow light allowing me to see that Im in a room containing just my bed. No doors, no windows are visible. The air smells of

something sharp and antiseptic. My right arm has several tubes that extend into the wall behind me. Im naked, but the bedclothes arc soothing against my skin. I

tentatively lift my left hand above the cover. Not only has it been scrubbed clean, the nails are filed in perfect ovals, the scars from the burns are less prominent. I touch my cheek, my lips, the puckered scar above my eyebrow, and am just running my fingers through my silken hair when I freeze. Apprehensively I ruffle the hair by my left ear. No, it wasnt an illusion. I can hear again. I try and sit up, but some sort of wide restraining band around my waist keeps me from rising more than a few inches. The physical confinement makes me panic and Im trying to pull myself up and wriggle my hips through the band when a portion of the wall slides open and in steps the redheaded Avox girl carrying a tray. The sight of her calms me and I stop trying to escape. I want to ask her a million questions, but Im afraid any familiarity would cause her harm. Obviously I am being closely monitored. She sets the tray across my thighs and presses something that raises me to a sitting position. While she adjusts my pillows, I risk one question. I say it out loud, as clearly as my rusty voice

will allow, so nothing will seem secretive. Did Peeta make it? She gives me a nod, and as she slips a spoon into my hand, I feel the pressure of friendship. I guess she did not wish me dead after all. And Peeta has made it. Of course, he did. With all their expensive equipment here. Still, I hadnt been sure until now. As the Avox leaves, the door closes noiselessly after her and I turn hungrily to the tray. A bowl of clear broth, a small serving of applesauce, and a glass of water. This is it? I think grouchily. Shouldnt my homecoming dinner be a little more spectacular? But I find its an effort to finish the spare meal before me. My stomach seems to have shrunk to the size of a chestnut, and I have to wonder how long Ive been out because I had no trouble eating a fairly sizable breakfast that last morning in the arena. Theres usually a lag of a few days between the end of the competition and the presentation of the victor so that they can put the starving, wounded, mess of a person back together again. Somewhere, Cinna and Portia will be creating our wardrobes for the public appearances. Haymitch and Effie will be arranging the banquet for our sponsors, reviewing the questions for our final interviews. Back home, District 12 is probably in chaos as they try and organize the homecoming celebrations for Peeta and me, given

that the last one was close to thirty years ago. Home! Prim and my mother! Gale! Even the thought of Prims scruffy old cat makes me smile. Soon I will be home! I want to get out of this bed. To see Peeta and Cinna, to find out more about whats been going on. And why shouldnt I? I feel fine. But as I start to work my way out of the band, I feel a cold liquid seeping into my vein from one of the tubes and almost immediately lose consciousness. This happens on and off for an indeterminate amount of time. My waking, eating, and, even though I resist the impulse

to try and escape the bed, being knocked out again. I seem to be in a strange, continual twilight. Only a few things register. The redheaded Avox girl has not returned since the feeding, my scars are disappearing, and do I imagine it? Or do I hear a mans voice yelling? Not in the Capitol accent, but in the rougher cadences of home. And I cant help having a vague, comforting feeling that someone is looking out for me. Then finally, the time arrives when I come to and theres nothing plugged into my right arm. The restraint around my middle has been removed and I am free to move about. I start to sit up but am arrested by the sight of my hands. The skins

perfection, smooth and glowing. Not only are the scars from the arena gone, but those accumulated over years of hunting have vanished without a trace. My forehead feels like satin, and when I try to find the burn on my calf, theres nothing. I slip my legs out of bed, nervous about how they will bear my weight and find them strong and steady. Lying at the foot of the bed is an outfit that makes me flinch. Its what all of us tributes wore in the arena. I stare at it as if it had teeth until I remember that, of course, this is what I will wear to greet my team. Im dressed in less than a minute and fidgeting in front of the wall where I know theres a door even if I cant see it when suddenly it slides open. I step into a wide, deserted hall that appears to have no other doors on it. But it must. And behind one of them must be Peeta. Now that Im conscious and moving, Im growing more and more anxious about him. He must be all right or the Avox girl wouldnt have said so. But I need to see him for myself. Peeta! I call out, since theres no one to ask. I hear my name in response, but its not his voice. Its a voice that provokes first irritation and then eagerness. Effie. I turn and see them all waiting in a big chamber at the end of the hall Effie, Haymitch, and Cinna. My feet take off without hesitation. Maybe a victor should show more restraint, more

superiority, especially when she knows this will be on tape, but I dont care. I run for them and surprise even myself when I launch into Haymitchs arms first. When he whispers in my ear, Nice job, sweetheart, it doesnt sound sarcastic. Effies somewhat teary and keeps patting my hair and talking about how she told everyone we were pearls. Cinna just hugs me tight and doesnt say anything. Then I notice Portia is absent and get a bad feeling. Wheres Portia? Is she with Peeta? He is all right, isnt he? I mean, hes alive? I blurt out. Hes fine. Only they want to do your reunion live on air at the ceremony, says Haymitch. Oh. Thats all, I say. The awful moment of thinking Peetas dead again passes. I guess Id want to see that myself. Go on with Cinna. He has to get you ready, says Haymitch. Its a relief to be alone with Cinna, to feel his protective arm around my shoulders as he guides me away from the cameras, down a few passages and to an elevator that leads to the

lobby of the Training Center. The hospital then is far underground, even beneath the gym where the tributes practiced tying knots and throwing spears. The windows of the lobby are darkened, and a handful of guards stand on duty. No one

else is there to see us cross to the tribute elevator. Our footsteps echo in the emptiness. And when we ride up to the twelfth floor, the faces of all the tributes who will never return flash across my mind and theres a heavy, tight place in my chest. When the elevator doors open, Venia, Flavius, and Octavia engulf me, talking so quickly and ecstatically I cant make out their words. The sentiment is clear though. They are truly thrilled to see me and Im happy to see them, too, although not like I was to see Cinna. Its more in the way one might be glad to see an affectionate trio of pets at the end of a particularly difficult day. They sweep me into the dining room and I get a real meal roast beef and peas and soft rolls although my portions are still being strictly controlled. Because when I ask for seconds, Im refused. No, no, no. They dont want it all coming back up on the stage, says Octavia, but she secretly slips me an extra roll under the table to let me know shes on my side. We go back to my room and Cinna disappears for a while as the prep team gets me ready. Oh, they did a full body polish on you, says Flavius enviously. Not a flaw left on your skin. But when I look at my naked body in the mirror, all I can see is how skinny I am. I mean, Im sure I was worse when I came out of the arena, but I can easily count my ribs. They take

care of the shower settings for me, and they go to work on my hair, nails, and makeup when Im done. They chatter so continuously that I barely have to reply, which is good, since I dont feel very talkative. Its funny, because even though theyre rattling on about the Games, its all about where they were or what they were doing or how they felt when a specific event occurred. I was still in bed! I had just had my eyebrows dyed! I swear I nearly fainted! Everything is about them, not the dying boys and girls in the arena. We dont wallow around in the Games this way in District 12. We grit our teeth and watch because we must and try to get back to business as soon as possible when theyre over. To keep from hating the prep team, I effectively tune out most of what theyre saying. Cinna comes in with what appears to be an unassuming yellow dress across his arms. Have you given up the whole girl on fire thing? I ask. You tell me, he says, and slips it over my head. I immediately notice the padding over my breasts, adding curves that hunger has stolen from my body. My hands go to my chest and I frown. I know, says Cinna before I can object. But the Gamemakers wanted to alter you surgically. Haymitch had a huge fight with them over it. This was the compromise. He stops me before I can look at my reflection.

Wait, dont forget the shoes. Venia helps me into a pair of flat leather sandals and I

turn to the mirror. I am still the girl on fire. The sheer fabric softly glows. Even the slight movement in the air sends a ripple up my body. By comparison, the chariot costume seems garish, the interview dress too contrived. In this dress, I give the illusion of wearing candlelight. What do you think? asks Cinna. I think its the best yet, I say. When I manage to pull my eyes away from the flickering fabric, Im in for something of a shock. My hairs loose, held back by a simple hairband. The makeup rounds and fills out the sharp angles of my face. A clear polish coats my nails. The sleeveless dress is gathered at my ribs, not my waist, largely eliminating any help the padding would have given my figure. The hem falls just to my knees. Without heels, you can see my true stature. I look, very simply, like a girl. A young one. Fourteen at the most. Innocent. Harmless. Yes, it is shocking that Cinna has pulled this off when you remember Ive just won the Games. This is a very calculated look. Nothing Cinna designs is arbitrary. I bite my lip trying to figure out his motivation. I thought itd be something more . . . Sophisticated-looking, I say. I thought Peeta would like this

better, he answers carefully. Peeta? No, its not about Peeta. Its about the Capitol and the Gamemakers and the audience. Although I do not yet understand Cinnas design, its a reminder the Games are not quite finished. And beneath his benign reply, I sense a warning. Of something he cant even mention in front of his own team. We take the elevator to the level where we trained. Its customary for the victor and his or her support team to rise from beneath the stage. First the prep team, followed by the escort, the stylist, the mentor, and finally the victor. Only this year, with two victors who share both an escort and a mentor, the whole thing has had to be rethought. I find myself in a poorly lit area under the stage. A brand-new metal plate has been installed to transport me upward. You can still see small piles of sawdust, smell fresh paint. Cinna and the prep team peel off to change into their own costumes and take their positions, leaving me alone. In the gloom, I see a makeshift wall about ten yards away and assume Peetas behind it. The rumbling of the crowd is loud, so I dont notice Haymitch until he touches my shoulder. I spring away, startled, still half in the arena, I guess. Easy, just me. Lets have a look at you, Haymitch says. I hold out my arms and turn once. Good enough. Its not much of a

compliment. But what? I say. Haymitchs eyes shift around my musty holding space, and he seems to make a decision. But nothing. How about a hug for luck? Okay, thats an odd request from Haymitch but, after all, we are victors. Maybe a hug for luck is in order. Only, when I put my arms around his neck, I find myself trapped in his embrace. He begins talking, very fast, very quietly in my ear, my hair concealing his lips. Listen up. Youre in trouble. Word is the Capitols furious about

you showing them up in the arena. The one thing they cant stand is being laughed at and theyre the joke of Panem, says Haymitch. I feel dread coursing through me now, but I laugh as though Haymitch is saying something completely delightful because nothing is covering my mouth. So, what? Your only defense can be you were so madly in love you werent responsible for your actions. Haymitch pulls back and adjusts my hairband. Got it, sweetheart? He could be talking about anything now. Got it, I say. Did you tell Peeta this? Dont have to, says Haymitch. Hes already there. But you think Im not? I say, taking the opportunity to straighten a bright red bow tie Cinna must have wrestled him into. Since when does it matter what I think?

says Haymitch. Better take our places. He leads me to the metal circle. This is your night, sweetheart. Enjoy it. He kisses me on the forehead and disappears into the gloom. I tug on my skirt, willing it to be longer, wanting it to cover the knocking in my knees. Then I realize its pointless. My whole bodys shaking like a leaf. Hopefully, it will be put down to excitement. After all, its my night. The damp, moldy smell beneath the stage threatens to choke me. A cold, clammy sweat breaks out on my skin and I cant rid myself of the feeling that the boards above my head are about to collapse, to bury me alive under the rubble. When I left the arena, when the trumpets played, I was supposed to be safe. From then on. For the rest of my life. But if what Haymitch says is true, and hes got no reason to lie, Ive never been in such a dangerous place in my life. Its so much worse than being hunted in the arena. There, I could only die. End of story. But out here Prim, my mother, Gale, the people of District 12, everyone I care about back home could be punished if I cant pull off the girl-driven-crazy-by-love scenario Haymitch has suggested. So I still have a chance, though. Funny, in the arena, when I poured out those berries, I was only thinking of outsmarting the Gamemakers, not how my actions would reflect on the Capitol. But

the Hunger Games are their weapon and you are not supposed to be able to defeat it. So now the Capitol will act as if theyve been in control the whole time. As if they orchestrated the whole event, right down to the double suicide. But that will only work if I play along with them. And Peeta . . . Peeta will suffer, too, if this goes wrong. But what was it Haymitch said when I asked if he had told Peeta the situation? That he had to pretend to be desperately in love? Dont have to. Hes already there. Already thinking ahead of me in the Games again and well aware of the danger were in? Or . . . Already desperately in love? I dont know. I havent even begun to separate out my feelings about Peeta. Its too complicated. What I did as part of the Games. As opposed to what I did out of anger at the Capitol. Or because of how it would be viewed back in District 12. Or simply because it was the only decent thing to do.

Or what I did because I cared about him. These are questions to be unraveled back home, in the peace and quiet of the woods, when no one is watching. Not here with every eye upon me. But I wont have that luxury for who knows how long. And right now, the most dangerous part of the Hunger Games is about to begin.

27.

The anthem booms in my ears, and then I hear Caesar Flickerman greeting the audience. Does he know how crucial it is to get every word right from now on? He must. He will want to help us. The crowd breaks into applause as the prep teams are presented. I imagine Flavius, Venia, and Octavia bouncing around and taking ridiculous, bobbing bows. Its a safe bet theyre clueless. Then Effies introduced. How long shes waited for this moment. I hope shes able to enjoy it because as misguided as Effie can be, she has a very keen instinct about certain things and must at least suspect were in trouble. Portia and Cinna receive huge cheers, of course, theyve been brilliant, had a dazzling debut. I now understand Cinnas choice of dress for me for tonight. Ill need to look as girlish and innocent as possible. Haymitchs appearance brings a round of stomping that goes on at least five minutes. Well, hes accomplished a first. Keeping not only one but two tributes alive. What if he hadnt warned me in time? Would I have acted differently? Flaunted the moment with the berries in the Capitols face? No, I dont think so. But I could easily have been a lot less convincing

than I need to be now. Right now. Because I can feel the plate lifting me up to the stage. Blinding lights. The deafening roar rattles the metal under my feet. Then theres Peeta just a few yards away. He looks so clean and healthy and beautiful, I can hardly recognize him. But his smile is the same whether in mud or in the Capitol and when I see it, I take about three steps and fling myself into his arms. He staggers back, almost losing his balance, and thats when I realize the slim, metal contraption in his hand is some kind of cane. He rights himself and we just cling to each other while the audience goes insane. Hes kissing me and all the time Im thinking, Do you know? Do you know how much danger were in? After about ten minutes of this, Caesar Flickerman taps on his shoulder to continue the show, and Peeta just pushes him aside without even glancing at him. The audience goes berserk. Whether he knows or not, Peeta is, as usual, playing the crowd exactly right. Finally, Haymitch interrupts us and gives us a good-natured shove toward the victors chair. Usually, this is a single, ornate chair from which the winning tribute watches a film of the highlights of the Games, but since there are two of us, the Gamemakers have provided a plush red velvet couch. A small one, my mother would call it a love seat, I think. I sit so close

to Peeta that Im practically on his lap, but one look from Haymitch tells me it isnt enough. Kicking off my sandals, I tuck my feet to the side and lean my head against

Peetas shoulder. His arm goes around me automatically, and I feel like Im back in the cave, curled up against him, trying to keep warm. His shirt is made of the same yellow material as my dress, but Portias put him in long black pants. No sandals, either, but a pair of sturdy black boots he keeps solidly planted on the stage. I wish Cinna had given me a similar outfit, I feel so vulnerable in this flimsy dress. But I guess that was the point. Caesar Flickerman makes a few more jokes, and then its time for the show. This will last exactly three hours and is required viewing for all of Panem. As the lights dim and the seal appears on the screen, I realize Im unprepared for this. I do not want to watch my twenty-two fellow tributes die. I saw enough of them die the first time. My heart starts pounding and I have a strong impulse to run. How have the other victors faced this alone? During the highlights, they periodically show the winners reaction up on a box in the corner of the screen. I think back to earlier years . . . Some are triumphant, pumping their fists in the air, beating their

chests. Most just seem stunned. All I know is that the only thing keeping me on this love seat is Peeta his arm around my shoulder, his other hand claimed by both of mine. Of course, the previous victors didnt have the Capitol looking for a way to destroy them. Condensing several weeks into three hours is quite a feat, especially when you consider how many cameras were going at once. Whoever puts together the highlights has to choose what sort of story to tell. This year, for the first time, they tell a love story. I know Peeta and I won, but a disproportionate amount of time is spent on us, right from the beginning. Im glad though, because it supports the whole crazy-in-love thing thats my defense for defying the Capitol, plus it means we wont have as much time to linger over the deaths. The first half hour or so focuses on the pre-arena events, the reaping, the chariot ride through the Capitol, our training scores, and our interviews. Theres this sort of upbeat soundtrack playing under it that makes it twice as awful because, of course, almost everyone on-screen is dead. Once were in the arena, theres detailed coverage of the bloodbath and then the filmmakers basically alternate between shots of tributes dying and shots of us. Mostly Peeta really, theres no question hes carrying this romance thing on his shoulders.

Now I see what the audience saw, how he misled the Careers about me, stayed awake the entire night under the tracker jacker tree, fought Cato to let me escape and even while he lay in that mud bank, whispered my name in his sleep. I seem heartless in comparison dodging fireballs, dropping nests, and blowing up supplies until I go hunting for Rue. They play her death in full, the spearing, my failed rescue attempt, my arrow through the boy from District 1s throat, Rue drawing her last breath in my arms. And the song. I get to sing every note of the song.

Something inside me shuts down and Im too numb to feel anything. Its like watching complete strangers in another Hunger Games. But I do notice they omit the part where I covered her in flowers. Right. Because even that smacks of rebellion. Things pick up for me once theyve announced two tributes from the same district can live and I shout out Peetas name and then clap my hands over my mouth. If Ive seemed indifferent to him earlier, I make up for it now, by finding him, nursing him back to health, going to the feast for the medicine, and being very free with my kisses. Objectively, I can see the mutts and Catos death are as gruesome as ever, but again, I

feel it happens to people I have never met. And then comes the moment with the berries. I can hear the audience hushing one another, not wanting to miss anything. A wave of gratitude to the filmmakers sweeps over me when they end not with the announcement of our victory, but with me pounding on the glass door of the hovercraft, screaming Peetas name as they try to revive him. In terms of survival, its my best moment all night. The anthems playing yet again and we rise as President Snow himself takes the stage followed by a little girl carrying a cushion that holds the crown. Theres just one crown, though, and you can hear the crowds confusion whose head will he place it on? until President Snow gives it a twist and it separates into two halves. He places the first around Peetas brow with a smile. Hes still smiling when he settles the second on my head, but his eyes, just inches from mine, are as unforgiving as a snakes. Thats when I know that even though both of us would have eaten the berries, I am to blame for having the idea. Im the instigator. Im the one to be punished. Much bowing and cheering follows. My arm is about to fall off from waving when Caesar Flickerman finally bids the audience good night, reminding them to tune in tomorrow for the final interviews. As if they have a choice. Peeta and I are whisked

to the presidents mansion for the Victory Banquet, where we have very little time to eat as Capitol officials and particularly generous sponsors elbow one another out of the way as they try to get their picture with us. Face after beaming face flashes by, becoming increasingly intoxicated as the evening wears on. Occasionally, I catch a glimpse of Haymitch, which is reassuring, or President Snow, which is terrifying, but I keep laughing and thanking people and smiling as my picture is taken. The one thing I never do is let go of Peetas hand. The sun is just peeking over the horizon when we straggle back to the twelfth floor of the Training Center. I think now Ill finally get a word alone with Peeta, but Haymitch sends him off with Portia to get something fitted for the interview and personally escorts me to my door. Why cant I talk to him? I ask. Plenty of time for talk when we get home, says Haymitch. Go to bed, youre on air at two. Despite Haymitchs running interference, Im

determined to see Peeta privately. After I toss and turn for a few hours, I slip into the hall. My first thought is to check the roof, but its empty. Even the city streets far below are deserted after the celebration last night. I go back to bed for a while and

then decide to go directly to his room, but when I try to turn the knob, I find my own bedroom door has been locked from the outside. I suspect Haymitch initially, but then theres a more insidious fear that the Capitol may by monitoring and confining me. Ive been unable to escape since the Hunger Games began, but this feels different, much more personal. This feels like Ive been imprisoned for a crime and Im awaiting sentencing. I quickly get back in bed and pretend to sleep until Effie Trinket comes to alert me to the start of another big, big, big day! I have about five minutes to eat a bowl of hot grain and stew before the prep team descends. All I have to say is, The crowd loved you! and its unnecessary to speak for the next couple of hours. When Cinna comes in, he shoos them out and dresses me in a white, gauzy dress and pink shoes. Then he personally adjusts my makeup until I seem to radiate a soft, rosy glow. We make idle chitchat, but Im afraid to ask him anything of real importance because after the incident with the door, I cant shake the feeling that Im being watched constantly. The interview takes place right down the hall in the sitting room. A space has been cleared and the love seat has been moved in and surrounded by vases of red and pink roses. There are only a handful of cameras to record the

event. No live audience at least. Caesar Flickerman gives me a warm hug when I. Come in. Congratulations, Katniss. How are you faring? Fine. Nervous about the interview, I say. Dont be. Were going to have a fabulous time, he says, giving my cheek a reassuring pat. Im not good at talking about myself, I say. Nothing you say will be wrong, he says. And I think, Oh, Caesar, if only that were true. But actually, President Snow may be arranging some sort of accident for me as we speak. Then Peetas there looking handsome in red and white, pulling me off to the side. I hardly get to see you. Haymitch seems bent on keeping us apart. Haymitch is actually bent on keeping us alive, but there are too many ears listening, so I just say, Yes, hes gotten very responsible lately. Well, theres just this and we go home. Then he cant watch us all the time, says Peeta. I feel a sort of shiver run through me and theres no time to analyze why, because theyre ready for us. We sit somewhat formally on the love seat, but Caesar says, Oh, go ahead and curl up next to him if you want. It looked very sweet. So I tuck my feet up and Peeta pulls me in close to him. Someone counts backward and just like that, were being broadcast live to the entire country. Caesar Flickerman is wonderful, teasing, joking, getting choked up when the occasion

presents itself. He and Peeta already have the rapport they established

that night of the first interview, that easy banter, so I just smile a lot and try to speak as little as possible. I mean, I have to talk some, but as soon as I can I redirect the conversation back to Peeta. Eventually though, Caesar begins to pose questions that insist on fuller answers. Well, Peeta, we know, from our days in the cave, that it was love at first sight for you from what, age five? Caesar says. From the moment I laid eyes on her, says Peeta. But, Katniss, what a ride for you. I think the real excitement for the audience was watching you fall for him. When did you realize you were in love with him? asks Caesar. Oh, thats a hard one . . . I give a faint, breathy laugh and look down at my hands. Help. Well, I know when it hit me. The night when you shouted out his name from that tree, says Caesar. Thank you, Caesar! I think, and then go with his idea. Yes, I guess that was it. I mean, until that point, I just tried not to think about what my feelings might be, honestly, because it was so confusing and it only made things worse if I actually cared about him. But then, in the tree, everything changed, I say. Why do you think that was? urges Caesar. Maybe . . .

Because for the first time . . . There was a chance I could keep him, I say. Behind a cameraman, I see Haymitch give a sort of huff with relief and I know Ive said the right thing. Caesar pulls out a handkerchief and has to take a moment because hes so moved. I can feel Peeta press his forehead into my temple and he asks, So now that youve got me, what are you going to do with me? I turn in to him. Put you somewhere you cant get hurt. And when he kisses me, people in the room actually sigh. For Caesar, this is a natural place to segue into all the ways we did get hurt in the arena, from burns, to stings, to wounds. But its not until we get around to the mutts that I forget Im on camera. When Caesar asks Peeta how his new leg is working out. New leg? I say, and I cant help reaching out and pulling up the bottom of Peetas pants. Oh, no, I whisper, taking in the metal-and-plastic device that has replaced his flesh. No one told you? asks Caesar gently. I shake my head. I havent had the chance, says Peeta with a slight shrug. Its my fault, I say. Because I used that tourniquet. Yes, its your fault Im alive, says Peeta. Hes right, says Caesar. Hed have bled to death for sure without it. I guess this is true, but I cant help feeling upset about it to the extent that Im afraid I might cry and then I remember everyone in the country is watching

me so I just bury my face in Peetas shirt. It takes them a couple of minutes to coax me back out because its better in the shirt, where no one can see me, and when I do come out, Caesar backs off questioning me so I can recover. In fact, he pretty much leaves me alone until the berries come up. Katniss, I know youve had a shock, but Ive got to ask. The moment when you pulled out those berries. What was going on in your mind . . . Hm? he says. I take

a long pause before I answer, trying to collect my thoughts. This is the crucial moment where I either challenged the Capitol or went so crazy at the idea of losing Peeta that I cant be held responsible for my actions. It seems to call for a big, dramatic speech, but all I get out is one almost inaudible sentence. I dont know, I just . . . Couldnt bear the thought of . . . Being without him. Peeta? Anything to add? asks Caesar. No. I think that goes for both of us, he says. Caesar signs off and its over. Everyones laughing and crying and hugging, but Im still not sure until I reach Haymitch. Okay? I whisper. Perfect, he answers. I go back to my room to collect a few things and find theres nothing to take but the mockingjay pin Madge gave me.

Someone returned it to my room after the Games. They drive us through the streets in a car with blackened windows, and the trains waiting for us. We barely have time to say good-bye to Cinna and Portia, although well see them in a few months, when we tour the districts for a round of victory ceremonies. Its the Capitols way of reminding people that the Hunger Games never really go away. Well be given a lot of useless plaques, and everyone will have to pretend they love us. The train begins moving and were plunged into night until we clear the tunnel and I take my first free breath since the reaping. Effie is accompanying us back and Haymitch, too, of course. We eat an enormous dinner and settle into silence in front of the television to watch a replay of the interview. With the Capitol growing farther away every second, I begin to think of home. Of Prim and my mother. Of Gale. I excuse myself to change out of my dress and into a plain shirt and pants. As I slowly, thoroughly wash the makeup from my face and put my hair in its braid, I begin transforming back into myself. Katniss Everdeen. A girl who lives in the Seam. Hunts in the woods. Trades in the Hob. I stare in the mirror as I try to remember who I am and who I am not. By the time I join the others, the pressure of Peetas arm around my shoulders feels alien.

When the train makes a brief stop for fuel, were allowed to go outside for some fresh air. Theres no longer any need to guard us. Peeta and I walk down along the track, hand in hand, and I cant find anything to say now that were alone. He stops to gather a bunch of wildflowers for me. When he presents them, I work hard to look pleased. Because he cant know that the pink-and-white flowers are the tops of wild onions and only remind me of the hours Ive spent gathering them with Gale. Gale. The idea of seeing Gale in a matter of hours makes my stomach churn. But why? I cant quite frame it in my mind. I only know that I feel like Ive been lying to someone who trusts me. Or more accurately, to two people. Ive been getting away with it up to this point because of the Games. But there will be no Games to hide behind back home. Whats wrong? Peeta asks. Nothing, I answer. We continue walking, past the end of

the train, out where even Im fairly sure there are no cameras hidden in the scrubby bushes along the track. Still no words come. Haymitch startles me when he lays a hand on my back. Even now, in the middle of nowhere, he keeps his voice down. Great job, you two. Just keep it up in the district until the cameras are gone.

We should be okay. I watch him head back to the train, avoiding Peetas eyes. Whats he mean? Peeta asks me. Its the Capitol. They didnt like our stunt with the berries, I blurt out. What? What are you talking about? he says. It seemed too rebellious. So, Haymitch has been coaching me through the last few days. So I didnt make it worse, I say. Coaching you? But not me, says Peeta. He knew you were smart enough to get it right, I say. I didnt know there was anything to get right, says Peeta. So, what youre saying is, these last few days and then I guess . . . Back in the arena . . . That was just some strategy you two worked out. No. I mean, I couldnt even talk to him in the arena, could I? I stammer. But you knew what he wanted you to do, didnt you? says Peeta. I bite my lip. Katniss? He drops my hand and I take a step, as if to catch my balance. It was all for the Games, Peeta says. How you acted. Not all of it, I say, tightly holding onto my flowers. Then how much? No, forget that. I guess the real question is whats going to be left when we get home? he says. I dont know. The closer we get to District Twelve, the more confused I get, I say. He waits, for further explanation, but nones forthcoming. Well, let me know when you work it out, he says, and the pain in his voice is palpable. I know my ears are healed because, even with the rumble of the engine, I can hear every step he takes back to the train. By the time Ive climbed aboard, Peeta has disappiared into his room for the night. I dont see him the next morning, either. In fact, the next time he turns up, were pulling into District 12. He gives me a nod, his face expressionless. I want to tell him that hes not being fair. That we were strangers. That I did what it took to stay alive, to keep us both alive in the arena. That I cant explain how things are with Gale because I dont know myself. That its no good loving me because Im never going to get married anyway and hed just end up hating me later instead of sooner. That if I do have feelings for him, it doesnt matter because Ill never be able to afford the kind of love that leads to a family, to children. And how can he? How can he after what weve just been through? I also want to tell him how much I already miss him. But that wouldnt be fair on my part. So we just stand there silently, watching our grimy little station rise up around us. Through the window, I can see the platforms thick with cameras. Everyone will be eagerly watching our homecoming. Out of the corner of my eye, I see Peeta extend his hand. I look at him, unsure. One more time? For the audience? he says. His voice isnt angry. Its hollow, which is worse.


Already the boy with the bread is slipping away from me. I take his hand, holding on tightly, preparing for the cameras, and dreading the moment when I will finally have to let go.

END OF BOOK ONE

9.
I stop trying to sleep after my first few attempts are
interrupted by unspeakable nightmares. After that, I just lie
still and do fake breathing whenever someone checks on
me. In the morning, I'm released from the hospital and
instructed to take it easy. Cressida asks me to record a
few lines for a new Mockingjay propo. At lunch, I keep
waiting for people to bring up Peeta's appearance, but no
one does. Someone must have seen it besides Finnick
and me.
I have training, but Gale's scheduled to work with
Beetee on weapons or something, so I get permission to
take Finnick to the woods. We wander around awhile and
then ditch our communicators under a bush. When we're a
safe distance away, we sit and discuss Peeta's broadcast.
"I haven't heard one word about it. No one's told you
anything?" Finnick says. I shake my head. He pauses
before he asks, "Not even Gale?" I'm clinging to a shred of
hope that Gale honestly knows nothing about Peeta's
message. But I have a bad feeling he does. "Maybe he's
trying to find a time to tell you privately."
"Maybe," I say.
We stay silent so long that a buck wanders into range. I
take it down with an arrow. Finnick hauls it back to the
fence.
For dinner, there's minced venison in the stew. Gale
walks me back to Compartment E after we eat. When I ask
him what's been going on, again there's no mention of
Peeta. As soon as my mother and sister are asleep, I slip
the pearl from the drawer and spend a second sleepless
night clutching it in my hand, replaying Peeta's words in my
head. "Ask yourself, do you really trust the people you're
working with? Do you really know what's going on? And if
you don't...find out." Find out. What? From who? And how
can Peeta know anything except what the Capitol tells him?
It's just a Capitol propo. More noise. But if Plutarch thinks
it's just the Capitol line, why didn't he tell me about it? Why
hasn't anyone let me or Finnick know?
Under this debate lies the real source of my distress:
Peeta. What have they done to him? And what are they
doing to him right now? Clearly, Snow did not buy the story
that Peeta and I knew nothing about the rebellion. And his
suspicions have been reinforced, now that I have come out
as the Mockingjay. Peeta can only guess about the rebel
tactics or make up things to tell his torturers. Lies, once
discovered, would be severely punished. How abandoned
by me he must feel. In his first interview, he tried to protect
me from the Capitol and rebels alike, and not only have I
failed to protect him, I've brought down more horrors upon
him.
Come morning, I stick my forearm in the wall and stare
groggily at the day's schedule. Immediately after breakfast,
I am slated for Production. In the dining hall, as I down my
hot grain and milk and mushy beets, I spot a communicuff
on Gale's wrist. "When did you get that back, Soldier
Hawthorne?" I ask.
"Yesterday. They thought if I'm going to be in the field
with you, it could be a backup system of communication,"
says Gale.
No one has ever offered me a communicuff. I wonder,
if I asked for one, would I get it? "Well, I guess one of us
has to be accessible," I say with an edge to my voice.
"What's that mean?" he says.
"Nothing. Just repeating what you said," I tell him. "And
I totally agree that the accessible one should be you. I just
hope I still have access to you as well."
Our eyes lock, and I realize how furious I am with Gale.
That I don't believe for a second that he didn't see Peeta's
propo. That I feel completely betrayed that he didn't tell me
about it. We know each other too well for him not to read
my mood and guess what has caused it.
"Katniss--" he begins. Already the admission of guilt is
in his tone.
I grab my tray, cross to the deposit area, and slam the
dishes onto the rack. By the time I'm in the hallway, he's
caught up with me.
"Why didn't you say something?" he asks, taking my
arm.
"Why didn't I?" I jerk my arm free. "Why didn't you,
Gale? And I did, by the way, when I asked you last night
about what had been going on!"
"I'm sorry. All right? I didn't know what to do. I wanted to
tell you, but everyone was afraid that seeing Peeta's propo
would make you sick," he says.
"They were right. It did. But not quite as sick as you
lying to me for Coin." At that moment, his communicuff
starts beeping. "There she is. Better run. You have things to
tell her."
For a moment, real hurt registers on his face. Then
cold anger replaces it. He turns on his heel and goes.
Maybe I have been too spiteful, not given him enough time
to explain. Maybe everyone is just trying to protect me by
lying to me. I don't care. I'm sick of people lying to me for
my own good. Because really it's mostly for their own good.
Lie to Katniss about the rebellion so she doesn't do
anything crazy. Send her into the arena without a clue so we
can fish her out. Don't tell her about Peeta's propo because
it might make her sick, and it's hard enough to get a decent
performance out of her as it is.
I do feel sick. Heartsick. And too tired for a day of
production. But I'm already at Remake, so I go in. Today, I
discover, we will be returning to District 12. Cressida wants
to do unscripted interviews with Gale and me throwing light
on our demolished city.
"If you're both up for that," says Cressida, looking
closely at my face.
"Count me in," I say. I stand, uncommunicative and
stiff, a mannequin, as my prep team dresses me, does my
hair, and dabs makeup on my face. Not enough to show,
only enough to take the edge off the circles under my
sleepless eyes.
Boggs escorts me down to the Hangar, but we don't
talk beyond a preliminary greeting. I'm grateful to be spared
another exchange about my disobedience in 8, especially
since his mask looks so uncomfortable.
At the last moment, I remember to send a message to
my mother about my leaving 13, and stress that it won't be
dangerous. We board a hovercraft for the short ride to 12
and I'm directed to a seat at a table where Plutarch, Gale,
and Cressida are poring over a map. Plutarch's brimming
with satisfaction as he shows me the before/after effects of
the first couple of propos. The rebels, who were barely
maintaining a foothold in several districts, have rallied. They
have actually taken 3 and 11--the latter so crucial since it's
Panem's main food supplier--and have made inroads in
several other districts as well.
"Hopeful. Very hopeful indeed," says Plutarch.
"Fulvia's going to have the first round of We Remember
spots ready tonight, so we can target the individual districts
with their dead. Finnick's absolutely marvelous."
"It's painful to watch, actually," says Cressida. "He
knew so many of them personally."
"That's what makes it so effective," says Plutarch.
"Straight from the heart. You're all doing beautifully. Coin
could not be more pleased."
Gale didn't tell them, then. About my pretending not to
see Peeta and my anger at their cover-up. But I guess it's
too little, too late, because I still can't let it go. It doesn't
matter. He's not speaking to me, either.
It's not until we land in the Meadow that I realize
Haymitch isn't among our company. When I ask Plutarch
about his absence, he just shakes his head and says, "He
couldn't face it."
"Haymitch? Not able to face something? Wanted a
day off, more likely," I say.
"I think his actual words were 'I couldn't face it without a
bottle,'" says Plutarch.
I roll my eyes, long out of patience with my mentor, his
weakness for drink, and what he can or can't confront. But
about five minutes after my return to 12, I'm wishing I had a
bottle myself. I thought I'd come to terms with 12's demise--
heard of it, seen it from the air, and wandered through its
ashes. So why does everything bring on a fresh pang of
grief? Was I simply too out of it before to fully register the
loss of my world? Or is it the look on Gale's face as he
takes in the destruction on foot that makes the atrocity feel
brand-new?
Cressida directs the team to start with me at my old
house. I ask her what she wants me to do. "Whatever you
feel like," she says. Standing back in my kitchen, I don't feel
like doing anything. In fact, I find myself focusing up at the
sky--the only roof left--because too many memories are
drowning me. After a while, Cressida says, "That's fine,
Katniss. Let's move on."
Gale doesn't get off so easily at his old address.
Cressida films him in silence for a few minutes, but just as
he pulls the one remnant of his previous life from the ashes-
-a twisted metal poker--she starts to question him about his
family, his job, life in the Seam. She makes him go back to
the night of the firebombing and reenact it, starting at his
house, working his way down across the Meadow and
through the woods to the lake. I straggle behind the film
crew and the bodyguards, feeling their presence to be a
violation of my beloved woods. This is a private place, a
sanctuary, already corrupted by the Capitol's evil. Even
after we've left behind the charred stumps near the fence,
we're still tripping over decomposing bodies. Do we have
to record it for everyone to see?
By the time we reach the lake, Gale seems to have lost
his ability to speak. Everyone's dripping in sweat--
especially Castor and Pollux in their insect shells--and
Cressida calls for a break. I scoop up handfuls of water
from the lake, wishing I could dive in and surface alone and
naked and unobserved. I wander around the perimeter for a
while. When I come back around to the little concrete house
beside the lake, I pause in the doorway and see Gale
propping the crooked poker he salvaged against the wall
by the hearth. For a moment I have an image of a lone
stranger, sometime far in the future, wandering lost in the
wilderness and coming upon this small place of refuge, with
the pile of split logs, the hearth, the poker. Wondering how
it came to be. Gale turns and meets my eyes and I know
he's thinking about our last meeting here. When we fought
over whether or not to run away. If we had, would District 12
still be there? I think it would. But the Capitol would still be
in control of Panem as well.
Cheese sandwiches are passed around and we eat
them in the shade of the trees. I intentionally sit at the far
edge of the group, next to Pollux, so I don't have to talk. No
one's talking much, really. In the relative quiet, the birds
take back the woods. I nudge Pollux with my elbow and
point out a small black bird with a crown. It hops to a new
branch, momentarily opening its wings, showing off its
white patches. Pollux gestures to my pin and raises his
eyebrows questioningly. I nod, confirming it's a mockingjay.
I hold up one finger to say Wait, I'll show you, and whistle a
birdcall. The mockingjay cocks its head and whistles the
call right back at me. Then, to my surprise, Pollux whistles a
few notes of his own. The bird answers him immediately.
Pollux's face breaks into an expression of delight and he
has a series of melodic exchanges with the mockingjay. My
guess is it's the first conversation he's had in years. Music
draws mockingjays like blossoms do bees, and in a short
while he's got half a dozen of them perched in the branches
over our heads. He taps me on the arm and uses a twig to
write a word in the dirt. SING?
Usually, I'd decline, but it's kind of impossible to say no
to Pollux, given the circumstances. Besides, the
mockingjays' song voices are different from their whistles,
and I'd like him to hear them. So, before I actually think
about what I'm doing, I sing Rue's four notes, the ones she
used to signal the end of the workday in 11. The notes that
ended up as the background music to her murder. The
birds don't know that. They pick up the simple phrase and
bounce it back and forth between them in sweet harmony.
Just as they did in the Hunger Games before the muttations
broke through the trees, chased us onto the Cornucopia,
and slowly gnawed Cato to a bloody pulp--
"Want to hear them do a real song?" I burst out.
Anything to stop those memories. I'm on my feet, moving
back into the trees, resting my hand on the rough trunk of a
maple where the birds perch. I have not sung "The Hanging
Tree" out loud for ten years, because it's forbidden, but I
remember every word. I begin softly, sweetly, as my father
did.
"Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Where they strung up a man they say
murdered three.
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree."
The mockingjays begin to alter their songs as they
become aware of my new offering.
"Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Where the dead man called out for his love
to flee.
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree."
I have the birds' attention now. In one more verse,
surely they will have captured the melody, as it's simple and
repeats four times with little variation.
"Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Where I told you to run, so we'd both be free.
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree."
A hush in the trees. Just the rustle of leaves in the
breeze. But no birds, mockingjay or other. Peeta's right.
They do fall silent when I sing. Just as they did for my father.
"Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Wear a necklace of rope, side by side with
me.
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree."
The birds are waiting for me to continue. But that's it.
Last verse. In the stillness I remember the scene. I was
home from a day in the woods with my father. Sitting on the
floor with Prim, who was just a toddler, singing "The
Hanging Tree." Making us necklaces out of scraps of old
rope like it said in the song, not knowing the real meaning
of the words. The tune was simple and easy to harmonize
to, though, and back then I could memorize almost anything
set to music after a round or two. Suddenly, my mother
snatched the rope necklaces away and was yelling at my
father. I started to cry because my mother never yelled, and
then Prim was wailing and I ran outside to hide. As I had
exactly one hiding spot--in the Meadow under a
honeysuckle bush--my father found me immediately. He
calmed me down and told me everything was fine, only
we'd better not sing that song anymore. My mother just
wanted me to forget it. So, of course, every word was
immediately, irrevocably branded into my brain.
We didn't sing it anymore, my father and I, or even
speak of it. After he died, it used to come back to me a lot.
Being older, I began to understand the lyrics. At the
beginning, it sounds like a guy is trying to get his girlfriend
to secretly meet up with him at midnight. But it's an odd
place for a tryst, a hanging tree, where a man was hung for
murder. The murderer's lover must have had something to
do with the killing, or maybe they were just going to punish
her anyway, because his corpse called out for her to flee.
That's weird obviously, the talking-corpse bit, but it's not
until the third verse that "The Hanging Tree" begins to get
unnerving. You realize the singer of the song is the dead
murderer. He's still in the hanging tree. And even though he
told his lover to flee, he keeps asking if she's coming to
meet him. The phrase Where I told you to run, so we'd both
be free is the most troubling because at first you think he's
talking about when he told her to flee, presumably to safety.
But then you wonder if he meant for her to run to him. To
death. In the final stanza, it's clear that that's what he's
waiting for. His lover, with her rope necklace, hanging dead
next to him in the tree.
I used to think the murderer was the creepiest guy
imaginable. Now, with a couple of trips to the Hunger
Games under my belt, I decide not to judge him without
knowing more details. Maybe his lover was already
sentenced to death and he was trying to make it easier. To
let her know he'd be waiting. Or maybe he thought the place
he was leaving her was really worse than death. Didn't I
want to kill Peeta with that syringe to save him from the
Capitol? Was that really my only option? Probably not, but I
couldn't think of another at the time.
I guess my mother thought the whole thing was too
twisted for a seven-year-old, though. Especially one who
made her own rope necklaces. It wasn't like hanging was
something that only happened in a story. Plenty of people
were executed that way in 12. You can bet she didn't want
me singing it in front of my music class. She probably
wouldn't like me doing it here for Pollux even, but at least
I'm not--wait, no, I'm wrong. As I glance sideways, I see
Castor has been taping me. Everyone is watching me
intently. And Pollux has tears running down his cheeks
because no doubt my freaky song has dredged up some
terrible incident in his life. Great. I sigh and lean back
against the trunk. That's when the mockingjays begin their
rendition of "The Hanging Tree." In their mouths, it's quite
beautiful. Conscious of being filmed, I stand quietly until I
hear Cressida call, "Cut!"
Plutarch crosses to me, laughing. "Where do you
come up with this stuff? No one would believe it if we made
it up!" He throws an arm around me and kisses me on the
top of my head with a loud smack. "You're golden!"
"I wasn't doing it for the cameras," I say.
"Lucky they were on, then," he says. "Come on,
everybody, back to town!"
As we trudge back through the woods, we reach a
boulder, and both Gale and I turn our heads in the same
direction, like a pair of dogs catching a scent on the wind.
Cressida notices and asks what lies that way. We admit,
without acknowledging each other, it's our old hunting
rendezvous place. She wants to see it, even after we tell
her it's nothing really.
Nothing but a place where I was happy, I think.
Our rock ledge overlooking the valley. Perhaps a little
less green than usual, but the blackberry bushes hang
heavy with fruit. Here began countless days of hunting and
snaring, fishing and gathering, roaming together through
the woods, unloading our thoughts while we filled our game
bags. This was the doorway to both sustenance and sanity.
And we were each other's key.
There's no District 12 to escape from now, no
Peacekeepers to trick, no hungry mouths to feed. The
Capitol took away all of that, and I'm on the verge of losing
Gale as well. The glue of mutual need that bonded us so
tightly together for all those years is melting away. Dark
patches, not light, show in the spaces between us. How can
it be that today, in the face of 12's horrible demise, we are
too angry to even speak to each other?
Gale as good as lied to me. That was unacceptable,
even if he was concerned about my well-being. His apology
seemed genuine, though. And I threw it back in his face
with an insult to make sure it stung. What is happening to
us? Why are we always at odds now? It's all a muddle, but I
somehow feel that if I went back to the root of our troubles,
my actions would be at the heart of it. Do I really want to
drive him away?
My fingers encircle a blackberry and pluck it from its
stem. I roll it gently between my thumb and forefinger.
Suddenly, I turn to him and toss it in his direction. "And may
the odds--" I say. I throw it high so he has plenty of time to
decide whether to knock it aside or accept it.
Gale's eyes train on me, not the berry, but at the last
moment, he opens his mouth and catches it. He chews,
swallows, and there's a long pause before he says "--be
ever in your favor." But he does say it.
Cressida has us sit in the nook in the rocks, where it's
impossible not to be touching, and coaxes us into talking
about hunting. What drove us out into the woods, how we
met, favorite moments. We thaw, begin to laugh a little, as
we relate mishaps with bees and wild dogs and skunks.
When the conversation turns to how it felt to translate our
skill with weapons to the bombing in 8, I stop talking. Gale
just says, "Long overdue."
By the time we reach the town square, afternoon's
sinking into evening. I take Cressida to the rubble of the
bakery and ask her to film something. The only emotion I
can muster is exhaustion. "Peeta, this is your home. None
of your family has been heard of since the bombing. Twelve
is gone. And you're calling for a cease-fire?" I look across
the emptiness. "There's no one left to hear you."
As we stand before the lump of metal that was the
gallows, Cressida asks if either of us has ever been
tortured. In answer, Gale pulls off his shirt and turns his
back to the camera. I stare at the lash marks, and again
hear the whistling of the whip, see his bloody figure hanging
unconscious by his wrists.
"I'm done," I announce. "I'll meet you at the Victor's
Village. Something for...my mother."
I guess I walked here, but the next thing I'm conscious
of is sitting on the floor in front of the kitchen cabinets of our
house in the Victor's Village. Meticulously lining ceramic
jars and glass bottles into a box. Placing clean cotton
bandages between them to prevent breaking. Wrapping
bunches of dried flowers.
Suddenly, I remember the rose on my dresser. Was it
real? If so, is it still up there? I have to resist the temptation
to check. If it's there, it will only frighten me all over again. I
hurry with my packing.
When the cabinets are empty, I rise to find that Gale
has materialized in my kitchen. It's disturbing how
soundlessly he can appear. He's leaning on the table, his
fingers spread wide against the wood grain. I set the box
between us. "Remember?" he asks. "This is where you
kissed me."
So the heavy dose of morphling administered after the
whipping wasn't enough to erase that from his
consciousness. "I didn't think you'd remember that," I say.
"Have to be dead to forget. Maybe even not then," he
tells me. "Maybe I'll be like that man in 'The Hanging Tree.'
Still waiting for an answer." Gale, who I have never seen
cry, has tears in his eyes. To keep them from spilling over, I
reach forward and press my lips against his. We taste of
heat, ashes, and misery. It's a surprising flavor for such a
gentle kiss. He pulls away first and gives me a wry smile. "I
knew you'd kiss me."
"How?" I say. Because I didn't know myself.
"Because I'm in pain," he says. "That's the only way I
get your attention." He picks up the box. "Don't worry,
Katniss. It'll pass." He leaves before I can answer.
I'm too weary to work through his latest charge. I spend
the short ride back to 13 curled up in a seat, trying to ignore
Plutarch going on about one of his favorite subjects--
weapons mankind no longer has at its disposal. High-flying
planes, military satellites, cell disintegrators, drones,
biological weapons with expiration dates. Brought down by
the destruction of the atmosphere or lack of resources or
moral squeamishness. You can hear the regret of a Head
Gamemaker who can only dream of such toys, who must
make do with hovercraft and land-to-land missiles and plain
old guns.
After dropping off my Mockingjay suit, I go straight to
bed without eating. Even so, Prim has to shake me to get
me up in the morning. After breakfast, I ignore my schedule
and take a nap in the supply closet. When I come to,
crawling out from between the boxes of chalk and pencils,
it's dinnertime again. I get an extra-large portion of pea
soup and am headed back to Compartment E when Boggs
intercepts me.
"There's a meeting in Command. Disregard your
current schedule," he says.
"Done," I say.
"Did you follow it at all today?" he asks in
exasperation.
"Who knows? I'm mentally disoriented." I hold up my
wrist to show my medical bracelet and realize it's gone.
"See? I can't even remember they took my bracelet. Why
do they want me in Command? Did I miss something?"
"I think Cressida wanted to show you the Twelve
propos. But I guess you'll see them when they air," he says.
"That's what I need a schedule of. When the propos
air," I say. He shoots me a look but doesn't comment
further.
People have crowded into Command, but they've
saved me a seat between Finnick and Plutarch. The
screens are already up on the table, showing the regular
Capitol feed.
"What's going on? Aren't we seeing the Twelve
propos?" I ask.
"Oh, no," says Plutarch. "I mean, possibly. I don't know
exactly what footage Beetee plans to use."
"Beetee thinks he's found a way to break into the feed
nationwide," says Finnick. "So that our propos will air in the
Capitol, too. He's down working on it in Special Defense
now. There's live programming tonight. Snow's making an
appearance or something. I think it's starting."
The Capitol seal appears, underscored by the anthem.
Then I'm staring directly into President Snow's snake eyes
as he greets the nation. He seems barricaded behind his
podium, but the white rose in his lapel is in full view. The
camera pulls back to include Peeta, off to one side in front
of a projected map of Panem. He's sitting in an elevated
chair, his shoes supported by a metal rung. The foot of his
prosthetic leg taps out a strange irregular beat. Beads of
sweat have broken through the layer of powder on his
upper lip and forehead. But it's the look in his eyes--angry
yet unfocused--that frightens me the most.
"He's worse," I whisper. Finnick grasps my hand, to
give me an anchor, and I try to hang on.
Peeta begins to speak in a frustrated tone about the
need for the cease-fire. He highlights the damage done to
key infrastructure in various districts, and as he speaks,
parts of the map light up, showing images of the
destruction. A broken dam in 7. A derailed train with a pool
of toxic waste spilling from the tank cars. A granary
collapsing after a fire. All of these he attributes to rebel
action.
Bam! Without warning, I'm suddenly on television,
standing in the rubble of the bakery.
Plutarch jumps to his feet. "He did it! Beetee broke in!"
The room's buzzing with reaction when Peeta's back,
distracted. He has seen me on the monitor. He tries to pick
up his speech by moving on to the bombing of a water
purification plant, when a clip of Finnick talking about Rue
replaces him. And then the whole thing breaks down into a
broadcast battle, as the Capitol tech masters try to fend off
Beetee's attack. But they are unprepared, and Beetee,
apparently anticipating he would not hold on to control, has
an arsenal of five- to ten-second clips to work with. We
watch the official presentation deteriorate as it's peppered
with choice shots from the propos.
Plutarch's in spasms of delight and most everybody is
cheering Beetee on, but Finnick remains still and
speechless beside me. I meet Haymitch's eyes from
across the room and see my own dread mirrored back. The
recognition that with every cheer, Peeta slips even farther
from our grasp.
The Capitol seal's back up, accompanied by a flat
audio tone. This lasts about twenty seconds before Snow
and Peeta return. The set is in turmoil. We're hearing frantic
exchanges from their booth. Snow plows forward, saying
that clearly the rebels are now attempting to disrupt the
dissemination of information they find incriminating, but
both truth and justice will reign. The full broadcast will
resume when security has been reinstated. He asks Peeta
if, given tonight's demonstration, he has any parting
thoughts for Katniss Everdeen.
At the mention of my name, Peeta's face contorts in
effort. "Katniss...how do you think this will end? What will be
left? No one is safe. Not in the Capitol. Not in the districts.
And you...in Thirteen..." He inhales sharply, as if fighting for
air; his eyes look insane. "Dead by morning!"
Off camera, Snow orders, "End it!" Beetee throws the
whole thing into chaos by flashing a still shot of me standing
in front of the hospital at three-second intervals. But
between the images, we are privy to the real-life action
being played out on the set. Peeta's attempt to continue
speaking. The camera knocked down to record the white
tiled floor. The scuffle of boots. The impact of the blow that's
inseparable from Peeta's cry of pain.
And his blood as it splatters the tiles.
PART II
"THE ASSAULT"
10
The scream begins in my lower back and works its
way up through my body only to jam in my throat. I am Avox
mute, choking on my grief. Even if I could release the
muscles in my neck, let the sound tear into space, would
anyone notice it? The room's in an uproar. Questions and
demands ring out as they try to decipher Peeta's words.
"And you...in Thirteen...dead by morning!" Yet no one is
asking about the messenger whose blood has been
replaced by static.
A voice calls the others to attention. "Shut up!" Every
pair of eyes falls on Haymitch. "It's not some big mystery!
The boy's telling us we're about to be attacked. Here. In
Thirteen."
"How would he have that information?"
"Why should we trust him?"
"How do you know?"
Haymitch gives a growl of frustration. "They're beating
him bloody while we speak. What more do you need?
Katniss, help me out here!"
I have to give myself a shake to free my words.
"Haymitch's right. I don't know where Peeta got the
information. Or if it's true. But he believes it is. And they're--
" I can't say aloud what Snow's doing to him.
"You don't know him," Haymitch says to Coin. "We do.
Get your people ready."
The president doesn't seem alarmed, only somewhat
perplexed, by this turn in events. She mulls over the words,
tapping one finger lightly on the rim of the control board in
front of her. When she speaks, she addresses Haymitch in
an even voice. "Of course, we have prepared for such a
scenario. Although we have decades of support for the
assumption that further direct attacks on Thirteen would be
counterproductive to the Capitol's cause. Nuclear missiles
would release radiation into the atmosphere, with
incalculable environmental results. Even routine bombing
could badly damage our military compound, which we know
they hope to regain. And, of course, they invite a
counterstrike. It is conceivable that, given our current
alliance with the rebels, those would be viewed as
acceptable risks."
"You think so?" says Haymitch. It's a shade too
sincere, but the subtleties of irony are often wasted in 13.
"I do. At any rate, we're overdue for a Level Five
security drill," says Coin. "Let's proceed with the lockdown."
She begins to type rapidly on her keyboard, authorizing her
decision. The moment she raises her head, it begins.
There have been two low-level drills since I arrived in
13. I don't remember much about the first. I was in intensive
care in the hospital and I think the patients were exempted,
as the complications of removing us for a practice drill
outweighed the benefits. I was vaguely aware of a
mechanical voice instructing people to congregate in yellow
zones. During the second, a Level Two drill meant for minor
crises--such as a temporary quarantine while citizens were
tested for contagion during a flu outbreak--we were
supposed to return to our living quarters. I stayed behind a
pipe in the laundry room, ignored the pulsating beeps
coming over the audio system, and watched a spider
construct a web. Neither experience has prepared me for
the wordless, eardrum-piercing, fear-inducing sirens that
now permeate 13. There would be no disregarding this
sound, which seems designed to throw the whole
population into a frenzy. But this is 13 and that doesn't
happen.
Boggs guides Finnick and me out of Command, along
the hall to a doorway, and onto a wide stairway. Streams of
people are converging to form a river that flows only
downward. No one shrieks or tries to push ahead. Even the
children don't resist. We descend, flight after flight,
speechless, because no word could be heard above this
sound. I look for my mother and Prim, but it's impossible to
see anyone but those immediately around me. They're both
working in the hospital tonight, though, so there's no way
they can miss the drill.
My ears pop and my eyes feel heavy. We are coalmine
deep. The only plus is that the farther we retreat into
the earth, the less shrill the sirens become. It's as if they
were meant to physically drive us away from the surface,
which I suppose they are. Groups of people begin to peel
off into marked doorways and still Boggs directs me
downward, until finally the stairs end at the edge of an
enormous cavern. I start to walk straight in and Boggs
stops me, shows me that I must wave my schedule in front
of a scanner so that I'm accounted for. No doubt the
information's going to some computer somewhere to make
sure no one's gone astray.
The place seems unable to decide if it's natural or
man-made. Certain areas of the walls are stone, while steel
beams and concrete heavily reinforce others. Sleeping
bunks are hewn right into the rock walls. There's a kitchen,
bathrooms, a first-aid station. This place was designed for
an extended stay.
White signs with letters or numbers are placed at
intervals around the cavern. As Boggs tells Finnick and me
to report to the area that matches our assigned quarters--in
my case E for Compartment E--Plutarch strolls up. "Ah,
here you are," he says. Recent events have had little effect
on Plutarch's mood. He still has a happy glow from
Beetee's success on the Airtime Assault. Eyes on the
forest, not on the trees. Not on Peeta's punishment or 13's
imminent blasting. "Katniss, obviously this is a bad moment
for you, what with Peeta's setback, but you need to be
aware that others will be watching you."
"What?" I say. I can't believe he actually just
downgraded Peeta's dire circumstances to a setback.
"The other people in the bunker, they'll be taking their
cue on how to react from you. If you're calm and brave,
others will try to be as well. If you panic, it could spread like
wildfire," explains Plutarch. I just stare at him. "Fire is
catching, so to speak," he continues, as if I'm being slow on
the uptake.
"Why don't I just pretend I'm on camera, Plutarch?" I
say.
"Yes! Perfect. One is always much braver with an
audience," he says. "Look at the courage Peeta just
displayed!"
It's all I can do not to slap him.
"I've got to get back to Coin before lockdown. You
keep up the good work!" he says, and then heads off.
I cross to the big letter E posted on the wall. Our space
consists of a twelve-by-twelve-foot square of stone floor
delineated by painted lines. Carved into the wall are two
bunks--one of us will be sleeping on the floor--and a
ground-level cube space for storage. A piece of white
paper, coated in clear plastic, reads BUNKER PROTOCOL. I
stare fixedly at the little black specks on the sheet. For a
while, they're obscured by the residual blood droplets that I
can't seem to wipe from my vision. Slowly, the words come
into focus. The first section is entitled "On Arrival."
1. Make sure all members of your Compartment are
accounted for.
My mother and Prim haven't arrived, but I was one of
the first people to reach the bunker. Both of them are
probably helping to relocate hospital patients.
2. Go to the Supply Station and secure one pack for
each member of your Compartment. Ready your
Living Area. Return pack(s).
I scan the cavern until I locate the Supply Station, a
deep room set off by a counter. People wait behind it, but
there's not a lot of activity there yet. I walk over, give our
compartment letter, and request three packs. A man
checks a sheet, pulls the specified packs from shelving,
and swings them up onto the counter. After sliding one on
my back and getting a grip on the other two with my hands, I
turn to find a group rapidly forming behind me. "Excuse
me," I say as I carry my supplies through the others. Is it a
matter of timing? Or is Plutarch right? Are these people
modeling their behavior on mine?
Back at our space, I open one of the packs to find a
thin mattress, bedding, two sets of gray clothing, a
toothbrush, a comb, and a flashlight. On examining the
contents of the other packs, I find the only discernible
difference is that they contain both gray and white outfits.
The latter will be for my mother and Prim, in case they have
medical duties. After I make up the beds, store the clothes,
and return the backpacks, I've got nothing to do but observe
the last rule.
3. Await further instructions.
I sit cross-legged on the floor to await. A steady flow of
people begins to fill the room, claiming spaces, collecting
supplies. It won't take long until the place is full up. I wonder
if my mother and Prim are going to stay the night at
wherever the hospital patients have been taken. But, no, I
don't think so. They were on the list here. I'm starting to get
anxious, when my mother appears. I look behind her into a
sea of strangers. "Where's Prim?" I ask.
"Isn't she here?" she replies. "She was supposed to
come straight down from the hospital. She left ten minutes
before I did. Where is she? Where could she have gone?"
I squeeze my lids shut tight for a moment, to track her
as I would prey on a hunt. See her react to the sirens, rush
to help the patients, nod as they gesture for her to descend
to the bunker, and then hesitate with her on the stairs. Torn
for a moment. But why?
My eyes fly open. "The cat! She went back for him!"
"Oh, no," my mother says. We both know I'm right.
We're pushing against the incoming tide, trying to get out of
the bunker. Up ahead, I can see them preparing to shut the
thick metal doors. Slowly rotating the metal wheels on
either side inward. Somehow I know that once they have
been sealed, nothing in the world will convince the soldiers
to open them. Perhaps it will even be beyond their control.
I'm indiscriminately shoving people aside as I shout for
them to wait. The space between the doors shrinks to a
yard, a foot; there are only a few inches left when I jam my
hand through the crack.
"Open it! Let me out!" I cry.
Consternation shows on the soldiers' faces as they
reverse the wheels a bit. Not enough to let me pass, but
enough to avoid crushing my fingers. I take the opportunity
to wedge my shoulder into the opening. "Prim!" I holler up
the stairs. My mother pleads with the guards as I try to
wriggle my way out. "Prim!"
Then I hear it. The faint sound of footsteps on the
stairs. "We're coming!" I hear my sister call.
"Hold the door!" That was Gale.
"They're coming!" I tell the guards, and they slide the
doors open about a foot. But I don't dare move--afraid
they'll lock us all out--until Prim appears, her cheeks flushed
with running, hauling Buttercup. I pull her inside and Gale
follows, twisting an armload of baggage sideways to get it
into the bunker. The doors are closed with a loud and final
clank.
"What were you thinking?" I give Prim an angry shake
and then hug her, squashing Buttercup between us.
Prim's explanation is already on her lips. "I couldn't
leave him behind, Katniss. Not twice. You should have seen
him pacing the room and howling. He'd come back to
protect us."
"Okay. Okay." I take a few breaths to calm myself, step
back, and lift Buttercup by the scruff of the neck. "I should've
drowned you when I had the chance." His ears flatten and
he raises a paw. I hiss before he gets a chance, which
seems to annoy him a little, since he considers hissing his
own personal sound of contempt. In retaliation, he gives a
helpless kitten mew that brings my sister immediately to his
defense.
"Oh, Katniss, don't tease him," she says, folding him
back in her arms. "He's already so upset."
The idea that I've wounded the brute's tiny cat feelings
just invites further taunting. But Prim's genuinely distressed
for him. So instead, I visualize Buttercup's fur lining a pair of
gloves, an image that has helped me deal with him over the
years. "Okay, sorry. We're under the big E on the wall.
Better get him settled in before he loses it." Prim hurries
off, and I find myself face-to-face with Gale. He's holding the
box of medical supplies from our kitchen in 12. Site of our
last conversation, kiss, fallout, whatever. My game bag's
slung across his shoulder.
"If Peeta's right, these didn't stand a chance," he says.
Peeta. Blood like raindrops on the window. Like wet
mud on boots.
"Thanks for...everything." I take our stuff. "What were
you doing up in our rooms?"
"Just double-checking," he says. "We're in Forty-
Seven if you need me."
Practically everyone withdrew to their spaces when the
doors shut, so I get to cross to our new home with at least
five hundred people watching me. I try to appear extra calm
to make up for my frantic crashing through the crowd. Like
that's fooling anyone. So much for setting an example. Oh,
who cares? They all think I'm nuts anyway. One man, who I
think I knocked to the floor, catches my eye and rubs his
elbow resentfully. I almost hiss at him, too.
Prim has Buttercup installed on the lower bunk, draped
in a blanket so that only his face pokes out. This is how he
likes to be when there's thunder, the one thing that actually
frightens him. My mother puts her box carefully in the cube. I
crouch, my back supported by the wall, to check what Gale
managed to rescue in my hunting bag. The plant book, the
hunting jacket, my parents' wedding photo, and the
personal contents of my drawer. My mockingjay pin now
lives with Cinna's outfit, but there's the gold locket and the
silver parachute with the spile and Peeta's pearl. I knot the
pearl into the corner of the parachute, bury it deep in the
recesses of the bag, as if it's Peeta's life and no one can
take it away as long as I guard it.
The faint sound of the sirens cuts off sharply. Coin's
voice comes over the district audio system, thanking us all
for an exemplary evacuation of the upper levels. She
stresses that this is not a drill, as Peeta Mellark, the District
12 victor, has possibly made a televised reference to an
attack on 13 tonight.
That's when the first bomb hits. There's an initial sense
of impact followed by an explosion that resonates in my
innermost parts, the lining of my intestines, the marrow of
my bones, the roots of my teeth. We're all going to die, I
think. My eyes turn upward, expecting to see giant cracks
race across the ceiling, massive chunks of stone raining
down on us, but the bunker itself gives only a slight shudder.
The lights go out and I experience the disorientation of total
darkness. Speechless human sounds--spontaneous
shrieks, ragged breaths, baby whimpers, one musical bit of
insane laughter--dance around in the charged air. Then
there's a hum of a generator, and a dim wavering glow
replaces the stark lighting that is the norm in 13. It's closer
to what we had in our homes in 12, when the candles and
fire burned low on a winter's night.
I reach for Prim in the twilight, clamp my hand on her
leg, and pull myself over to her. Her voice remains steady
as she croons to Buttercup. "It's all right, baby, it's all right.
We'll be okay down here."
My mother wraps her arms around us. I allow myself to
feel young for a moment and rest my head on her shoulder.
"That was nothing like the bombs in Eight," I say.
"Probably a bunker missile," says Prim, keeping her
voice soothing for the cat's sake. "We learned about them
during the orientation for new citizens. They're designed to
penetrate deep in the ground before they go off. Because
there's no point in bombing Thirteen on the surface
anymore."
"Nuclear?" I ask, feeling a chill run through me.
"Not necessarily," says Prim. "Some just have a lot of
explosives in them. But...it could be either kind, I guess."
The gloom makes it hard to see the heavy metal doors
at the end of the bunker. Would they be any protection
against a nuclear attack? And even if they were one
hundred percent effective at sealing out the radiation, which
is really unlikely, would we ever be able to leave this place?
The thought of spending whatever remains of my life in this
stone vault horrifies me. I want to run madly for the door and
demand to be released into whatever lies above. It's
pointless. They would never let me out, and I might start
some kind of stampede.
"We're so far down, I'm sure we're safe," says my
mother wanly. Is she thinking of my father's being blown to
nothingness in the mines? "It was a close call, though.
Thank goodness Peeta had the wherewithal to warn us."
The wherewithal. A general term that somehow
includes everything that was needed for him to sound the
alarm. The knowledge, the opportunity, the courage. And
something else I can't define. Peeta seemed to have been
waging a sort of battle in his mind, fighting to get the
message out. Why? The ease with which he manipulates
words is his greatest talent. Was his difficulty a result of his
torture? Something more? Like madness?
Coin's voice, perhaps a shade grimmer, fills the
bunker, the volume level flickering with the lights.
"Apparently, Peeta Mellark's information was sound and we
owe him a great debt of gratitude. Sensors indicate the first
missile was not nuclear, but very powerful. We expect more
will follow. For the duration of the attack, citizens are to stay
in their assigned areas unless otherwise notified."
A soldier alerts my mother that she's needed in the
first-aid station. She's reluctant to leave us, even though
she'll only be thirty yards away.
"We'll be fine, really," I tell her. "Do you think anything
could get past him?" I point to Buttercup, who gives me
such a halfhearted hiss, we all have to laugh a little. Even I
feel sorry for him. After my mother goes, I suggest, "Why
don't you climb in with him, Prim?"
"I know it's silly...but I'm afraid the bunk might collapse
on us during the attack," she says.
If the bunks collapse, the whole bunker will have given
way and buried us, but I decide this kind of logic won't
actually be helpful. Instead, I clean out the storage cube and
make Buttercup a bed inside. Then I pull a mattress in front
of it for my sister and me to share.
We're given clearance in small groups to use the
bathroom and brush our teeth, although showering has
been canceled for the day. I curl up with Prim on the
mattress, double layering the blankets because the cavern
emits a dank chill. Buttercup, miserable even with Prim's
constant attention, huddles in the cube and exhales cat
breath in my face.
Despite the disagreeable conditions, I'm glad to have
time with my sister. My extreme preoccupation since I
came here--no, since the first Games, really--has left little
attention for her. I haven't been watching over her the way I
should, the way I used to. After all, it was Gale who checked
our compartment, not me. Something to make up for.
I realize I've never even bothered to ask her about how
she's handling the shock of coming here. "So, how are you
liking Thirteen, Prim?" I offer.
"Right now?" she asks. We both laugh. "I miss home
badly sometimes. But then I remember there's nothing left
to miss anymore. I feel safer here. We don't have to worry
about you. Well, not the same way." She pauses, and then
a shy smile crosses her lips. "I think they're going to train
me to be a doctor."
It's the first I've heard of it. "Well, of course, they are.
They'd be stupid not to."
"They've been watching me when I help out in the
hospital. I'm already taking the medic courses. It's just
beginner's stuff. I know a lot of it from home. Still, there's
plenty to learn," she tells me.
"That's great," I say. Prim a doctor. She couldn't even
dream of it in 12. Something small and quiet, like a match
being struck, lights up the gloom inside me. This is the sort
of future a rebellion could bring.
"What about you, Katniss? How are you managing?"
Her fingertip moves in short, gentle strokes between
Buttercup's eyes. "And don't say you're fine."
It's true. Whatever the opposite of fine is, that's what I
am. So I go ahead and tell her about Peeta, his
deterioration on-screen, and how I think they must be killing
him at this very moment. Buttercup has to rely on himself for
a while, because now Prim turns her attention to me. Pulling
me closer, brushing the hair back behind my ears with her
fingers. I've stopped talking because there's really nothing
left to say and there's this piercing sort of pain where my
heart is. Maybe I'm even having a heart attack, but it doesn't
seem worth mentioning.
"Katniss, I don't think President Snow will kill Peeta,"
she says. Of course, she says this; it's what she thinks will
calm me. But her next words come as a surprise. "If he
does, he won't have anyone left you want. He won't have
any way to hurt you."
Suddenly, I am reminded of another girl, one who had
seen all the evil the Capitol had to offer. Johanna Mason,
the tribute from District 7, in the last arena. I was trying to
prevent her from going into the jungle where the jabberjays
mimicked the voices of loved ones being tortured, but she
brushed me off, saying, "They can't hurt me. I'm not like
the rest of you. There's no one left I love."
Then I know Prim is right, that Snow cannot afford to
waste Peeta's life, especially now, while the Mockingjay
causes so much havoc. He's killed Cinna already.
Destroyed my home. My family, Gale, and even Haymitch
are out of his reach. Peeta's all he has left.
"So, what do you think they'll do to him?" I ask.
Prim sounds about a thousand years old when she
speaks.
"Whatever it takes to break you."
11
What will break me?
This is the question that consumes me over the next
three days as we wait to be released from our prison of
safety. What will break me into a million pieces so that I am
beyond repair, beyond usefulness? I mention it to no one,
but it devours my waking hours and weaves itself
throughout my nightmares.
Four more bunker missiles fall over this period, all
massive, all very damaging, but there's no urgency to the
attack. The bombs are spread out over the long hours so
that just when you think the raid is over, another blast sends
shock waves through your guts. It feels more designed to
keep us in lockdown than to decimate 13. Cripple the
district, yes. Give the people plenty to do to get the place
running again. But destroy it? No. Coin was right on that
point. You don't destroy what you want to acquire in the
future. I assume what they really want, in the short term, is to
stop the Airtime Assaults and keep me off the televisions of
Panem.
We receive next to no information about what is
happening. Our screens never come on, and we get only
brief audio updates from Coin about the nature of the
bombs. Certainly, the war is still being waged, but as to its
status, we're in the dark.
Inside the bunker, cooperation is the order of the day.
We adhere to a strict schedule for meals and bathing,
exercise and sleep. Small periods of socialization are
granted to alleviate the tedium. Our space becomes very
popular because both children and adults have a
fascination with Buttercup. He attains celebrity status with
his evening game of Crazy Cat. I created this by accident a
few years ago, during a winter blackout. You simply wiggle
a flashlight beam around on the floor, and Buttercup tries to
catch it. I'm petty enough to enjoy it because I think it makes
him look stupid. Inexplicably, everyone here thinks he's
clever and delightful. I'm even issued a special set of
batteries--an enormous waste--to be used for this purpose.
The citizens of 13 are truly starved for entertainment.
It's on the third night, during our game, that I answer the
question eating away at me. Crazy Cat becomes a
metaphor for my situation. I am Buttercup. Peeta, the thing I
want so badly to secure, is the light. As long as Buttercup
feels he has the chance of catching the elusive light under
his paws, he's bristling with aggression. (That's how I've
been since I left the arena, with Peeta alive.) When the light
goes out completely, Buttercup's temporarily distraught and
confused, but he recovers and moves on to other things.
(That's what would happen if Peeta died.) But the one thing
that sends Buttercup into a tailspin is when I leave the light
on but put it hopelessly out of his reach, high on the wall,
beyond even his jumping skills. He paces below the wall,
wails, and can't be comforted or distracted. He's useless
until I shut the light off. (That's what Snow is trying to do to
me now, only I don't know what form his game takes.)
Maybe this realization on my part is all Snow needs.
Thinking that Peeta was in his possession and being
tortured for rebel information was bad. But thinking that he's
being tortured specifically to incapacitate me is
unendurable. And it's under the weight of this revelation that
I truly begin to break.
After Crazy Cat, we're directed to bed. The power's
been coming and going; sometimes the lamps burn at full
brightness, other times we squint at one another in the
brownouts. At bedtime they turn the lamps to near darkness
and activate safety lights in each space. Prim, who's
decided the walls will hold up, snuggles with Buttercup on
the lower bunk. My mother's on the upper. I offer to take a
bunk, but they make me keep to the floor mattress since I
flail around so much when I'm sleeping.
I'm not flailing now, as my muscles are rigid with the
tension of holding myself together. The pain over my heart
returns, and from it I imagine tiny fissures spreading out into
my body. Through my torso, down my arms and legs, over
my face, leaving it crisscrossed with cracks. One good jolt
of a bunker missile and I could shatter into strange, razorsharp
shards.
When the restless, wiggling majority has settled into
sleep, I carefully extricate myself from my blanket and tiptoe
through the cavern until I find Finnick, feeling for some
unspecified reason that he will understand. He sits under
the safety light in his space, knotting his rope, not even
pretending to rest. As I whisper my discovery of Snow's
plan to break me, it dawns on me. This strategy is very old
news to Finnick. It's what broke him.
"This is what they're doing to you with Annie, isn't it?" I
ask.
"Well, they didn't arrest her because they thought she'd
be a wealth of rebel information," he says. "They know I'd
never have risked telling her anything like that. For her own
protection."
"Oh, Finnick. I'm so sorry," I say.
"No, I'm sorry. That I didn't warn you somehow," he tells
me.
Suddenly, a memory surfaces. I'm strapped to my bed,
mad with rage and grief after the rescue. Finnick is trying to
console me about Peeta. "They'll figure out he doesn't
know anything pretty fast. And they won't kill him if they
think they can use him against you."
"You did warn me, though. On the hovercraft. Only
when you said they'd use Peeta against me, I thought you
meant like bait. To lure me into the Capitol somehow," I
say.
"I shouldn't have said even that. It was too late for it to
be of any help to you. Since I hadn't warned you before the
Quarter Quell, I should've shut up about how Snow
operates." Finnick yanks on the end of his rope, and an
intricate knot becomes a straight line again. "It's just that I
didn't understand when I met you. After your first Games, I
thought the whole romance was an act on your part. We all
expected you'd continue that strategy. But it wasn't until
Peeta hit the force field and nearly died that I--" Finnick
hesitates.
I think back to the arena. How I sobbed when Finnick
revived Peeta. The quizzical look on Finnick's face. The
way he excused my behavior, blaming it on my pretend
pregnancy. "That you what?"
"That I knew I'd misjudged you. That you do love him.
I'm not saying in what way. Maybe you don't know yourself.
But anyone paying attention could see how much you care
about him," he says gently.
Anyone? On Snow's visit before the Victory Tour, he
challenged me to erase any doubts of my love for Peeta.
"Convince me," Snow said. It seems, under that hot pink
sky with Peeta's life in limbo, I finally did. And in doing so, I
gave him the weapon he needed to break me.
Finnick and I sit for a long time in silence, watching the
knots bloom and vanish, before I can ask, "How do you
bear it?"
Finnick looks at me in disbelief. "I don't, Katniss!
Obviously, I don't. I drag myself out of nightmares each
morning and find there's no relief in waking." Something in
my expression stops him. "Better not to give in to it. It takes
ten times as long to put yourself back together as it does to
fall apart."
Well, he must know. I take a deep breath, forcing
myself back into one piece.
"The more you can distract yourself, the better," he
says. "First thing tomorrow, we'll get you your own rope.
Until then, take mine."
I spend the rest of the night on my mattress
obsessively making knots, holding them up for Buttercup's
inspection. If one looks suspicious, he swipes it out of the
air and bites it a few times to make sure it's dead. By
morning, my fingers are sore, but I'm still holding on.
With twenty-four hours of quiet behind us, Coin finally
announces we can leave the bunker. Our old quarters have
been destroyed by the bombings. Everyone must follow
exact directions to their new compartments. We clean our
spaces, as directed, and file obediently toward the door.
Before I'm halfway there, Boggs appears and pulls me
from the line. He signals for Gale and Finnick to join us.
People move aside to let us by. Some even smile at me
since the Crazy Cat game seems to have made me more
lovable. Out the door, up the stairs, down the hall to one of
those multidirectional elevators, and finally we arrive at
Special Defense. Nothing along our route has been
damaged, but we are still very deep.
Boggs ushers us into a room virtually identical to
Command. Coin, Plutarch, Haymitch, Cressida, and
everybody else around the table looks exhausted.
Someone has finally broken out the coffee--although I'm
sure it's viewed only as an emergency stimulant--and
Plutarch has both hands wrapped tightly around his cup as
if at any moment it might be taken away.
There's no small talk. "We need all four of you suited
up and aboveground," says the president. "You have two
hours to get footage showing the damage from the
bombing, establish that Thirteen's military unit remains not
only functional but dominant, and, most important, that the
Mockingjay is still alive. Any questions?"
"Can we have a coffee?" asks Finnick.
Steaming cups are handed out. I stare distastefully at
the shiny black liquid, never having been much of a fan of
the stuff, but thinking it might help me stay on my feet.
Finnick sloshes some cream in my cup and reaches into
the sugar bowl. "Want a sugar cube?" he asks in his old
seductive voice. That's how we met, with Finnick offering
me sugar. Surrounded by horses and chariots, costumed
and painted for the crowds, before we were allies. Before I
had any idea what made him tick. The memory actually
coaxes a smile out of me. "Here, it improves the taste," he
says in his real voice, plunking three cubes in my cup.
As I turn to go suit up as the Mockingjay, I catch Gale
watching me and Finnick unhappily. What now? Does he
actually think something's going on between us? Maybe he
saw me go to Finnick's last night. I would've passed the
Hawthornes' space to get there. I guess that probably
rubbed him the wrong way. Me seeking out Finnick's
company instead of his. Well, fine. I've got rope burn on my
fingers, I can barely hold my eyes open, and a camera
crew's waiting for me to do something brilliant. And Snow's
got Peeta. Gale can think whatever he wants.
In my new Remake Room in Special Defense, my prep
team slaps me into my Mockingjay suit, arranges my hair,
and applies minimal makeup before my coffee's even
cooled. In ten minutes, the cast and crew of the next propos
are making the circuitous trek to the outside. I slurp my
coffee as we travel, finding that the cream and sugar greatly
enhance its flavor. As I knock back the dregs that have
settled to the bottom of the cup, I feel a slight buzz start to
run through my veins.
After climbing a final ladder, Boggs hits a lever that
opens a trapdoor. Fresh air rushes in. I take big gulps and
for the first time allow myself to feel how much I hated the
bunker. We emerge into the woods, and my hands run
through the leaves overhead. Some are just starting to turn.
"What day is it?" I ask no one in particular. Boggs tells me
September begins next week.
September. That means Snow has had Peeta in his
clutches for five, maybe six weeks. I examine a leaf on my
palm and see I'm shaking. I can't will myself to stop. I blame
the coffee and try to focus on slowing my breathing, which
is far too rapid for my pace.
Debris begins to litter the forest floor. We come to our
first crater, thirty yards wide and I can't tell how deep. Very.
Boggs says anyone on the first ten levels would likely have
been killed. We skirt the pit and continue on.
"Can you rebuild it?" Gale asks.
"Not anytime soon. That one didn't get much. A few
backup generators and a poultry farm," says Boggs. "We'll
just seal it off."
The trees disappear as we enter the area inside the
fence. The craters are ringed with a mixture of old and new
rubble. Before the bombing, very little of the current 13 was
aboveground. A few guard stations. The training area.
About a foot of the top floor of our building--where
Buttercup's window jutted out--with several feet of steel on
top of it. Even that was never meant to withstand more than
a superficial attack.
"How much of an edge did the boy's warning give
you?" asks Haymitch.
"About ten minutes before our own systems would've
detected the missiles," says Boggs.
"But it did help, right?" I ask. I can't bear it if he says
no.
"Absolutely," Boggs replies. "Civilian evacuation was
completed. Seconds count when you're under attack. Ten
minutes meant lives saved."
Prim, I think. And Gale. They were in the bunker only a
couple of minutes before the first missile hit. Peeta might
have saved them. Add their names to the list of things I can
never stop owing him for.
Cressida has the idea to film me in front of the ruins of
the old Justice Building, which is something of a joke since
the Capitol's been using it as a backdrop for fake news
broadcasts for years, to show that the district no longer
existed. Now, with the recent attack, the Justice Building
sits about ten yards away from the edge of a new crater.
As we approach what used to be the grand entrance,
Gale points out something and the whole party slows down.
I don't know what the problem is at first and then I see the
ground strewn with fresh pink and red roses. "Don't touch
them!" I yell. "They're for me!"
The sickeningly sweet smell hits my nose, and my
heart begins to hammer against my chest. So I didn't
imagine it. The rose on my dresser. Before me lies Snow's
second delivery. Long-stemmed pink and red beauties, the
very flowers that decorated the set where Peeta and I
performed our post-victory interview. Flowers not meant for
one, but for a pair of lovers.
I explain to the others as best I can. Upon inspection,
they appear to be harmless, if genetically enhanced,
flowers. Two dozen roses. Slightly wilted. Most likely
dropped after the last bombing. A crew in special suits
collects them and carts them away. I feel certain they will
find nothing extraordinary in them, though. Snow knows
exactly what he's doing to me. It's like having Cinna beaten
to a pulp while I watch from my tribute tube. Designed to
unhinge me.
Like then, I try to rally and fight back. But as Cressida
gets Castor and Pollux in place, I feel my anxiety building.
I'm so tired, so wired, and so unable to keep my mind on
anything but Peeta since I've seen the roses. The coffee
was a huge mistake. What I didn't need was a stimulant. My
body visibly shakes and I can't seem to catch my breath.
After days in the bunker, I'm squinting no matter what
direction I turn, and the light hurts. Even in the cool breeze,
sweat trickles down my face.
"So, what exactly do you need from me again?" I ask.
"Just a few quick lines that show you're alive and still
fighting," says Cressida.
"Okay." I take my position and then I'm staring into the
red light. Staring. Staring. "I'm sorry, I've got nothing."
Cressida walks up to me. "You feeling okay?" I nod.
She pulls a small cloth from her pocket and blots my face.
"How about we do the old Q-and-A thing?"
"Yeah. That would help, I think." I cross my arms to hide
the shaking. Glance at Finnick, who gives me a thumbs-up.
But he's looking pretty shaky himself.
Cressida's back in position now. "So, Katniss. You've
survived the Capitol bombing of Thirteen. How did it
compare with what you experienced on the ground in
Eight?"
"We were so far underground this time, there was no
real danger. Thirteen's alive and well and so am--" My voice
cuts off in a dry, squeaking sound.
"Try the line again," says Cressida. "'Thirteen's alive
and well and so am I.'"
I take a breath, trying to force air down into my
diaphragm. "Thirteen's alive and so--" No, that's wrong.
I swear I can still smell those roses.
"Katniss, just this one line and you're done today. I
promise," says Cressida. "'Thirteen's alive and well and so
am I.'"
I swing my arms to loosen myself up. Place my fists on
my hips. Then drop them to my sides. Saliva's filling my
mouth at a ridiculous rate and I feel vomit at the back of my
throat. I swallow hard and open my lips so I can get the
stupid line out and go hide in the woods and--that's when I
start crying.
It's impossible to be the Mockingjay. Impossible to
complete even this one sentence. Because now I know that
everything I say will be directly taken out on Peeta. Result in
his torture. But not his death, no, nothing so merciful as that.
Snow will ensure that his life is much worse than death.
"Cut," I hear Cressida say quietly.
"What's wrong with her?" Plutarch says under his
breath.
"She's figured out how Snow's using Peeta," says
Finnick.
There's something like a collective sigh of regret from
the semicircle of people spread out before me. Because I
know this now. Because there will never be a way for me to
not know this again. Because, beyond the military
disadvantage losing a Mockingjay entails, I am broken.
Several sets of arms would embrace me. But in the
end, the only person I truly want to comfort me is Haymitch,
because he loves Peeta, too. I reach out for him and say
something like his name and he's there, holding me and
patting my back. "It's okay. It'll be okay, sweetheart." He sits
me on a length of broken marble pillar and keeps an arm
around me while I sob.
"I can't do this anymore," I say.
"I know," he says.
"All I can think of is--what he's going to do to Peeta--
because I'm the Mockingjay!" I get out.
"I know." Haymitch's arm tightens around me.
"Did you see? How weird he acted? What are they--
doing to him?" I'm gasping for air between sobs, but I
manage one last phrase. "It's my fault!" And then I cross
some line into hysteria and there's a needle in my arm and
the world slips away.
It must be strong, whatever they shot into me, because
it's a full day before I come to. My sleep wasn't peaceful,
though. I have the sense of emerging from a world of dark,
haunted places where I traveled alone. Haymitch sits in the
chair by my bed, his skin waxen, his eyes bloodshot. I
remember about Peeta and start to tremble again.
Haymitch reaches out and squeezes my shoulder. "It's
all right. We're going to try to get Peeta out."
"What?" That makes no sense.
"Plutarch's sending in a rescue team. He has people
on the inside. He thinks we can get Peeta back alive," he
says.
"Why didn't we before?" I say.
"Because it's costly. But everyone agrees this is the
thing to do. It's the same choice we made in the arena. To
do whatever it takes to keep you going. We can't lose the
Mockingjay now. And you can't perform unless you know
Snow can't take it out on Peeta." Haymitch offers me a cup.
"Here, drink something."
I slowly sit up and take a sip of water. "What do you
mean, costly?"
He shrugs. "Covers will be blown. People may die. But
keep in mind that they're dying every day. And it's not just
Peeta; we're getting Annie out for Finnick, too."
"Where is he?" I ask.
"Behind that screen, sleeping his sedative off. He lost
it right after we knocked you out," says Haymitch. I smile a
little, feel a bit less weak. "Yeah, it was a really excellent
shoot. You two cracked up and Boggs left to arrange the
mission to get Peeta. We're officially in reruns."
"Well, if Boggs is leading it, that's a plus," I say.
"Oh, he's on top of it. It was volunteer only, but he
pretended not to notice me waving my hand in the air," says
Haymitch. "See? He's already demonstrated good
judgment."
Something's wrong. Haymitch's trying a little too hard
to cheer me up. It's not really his style. "So who else
volunteered?"
"I think there were seven altogether," he says
evasively.
I get a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. "Who else,
Haymitch?" I insist.
Haymitch finally drops the good-natured act. "You
know who else, Katniss. You know who stepped up first."
Of course I do.
Gale.
12
Today I might lose both of them.
I try to imagine a world where both Gale's and Peeta's
voices have ceased. Hands stilled. Eyes unblinking. I'm
standing over their bodies, having a last look, leaving the
room where they lie. But when I open the door to step out
into the world, there's only a tremendous void. A pale gray
nothingness that is all my future holds.
"Do you want me to have them sedate you until it's
over?" asks Haymitch. He's not joking. This is a man who
spent his adult life at the bottom of a bottle, trying to
anesthetize himself against the Capitol's crimes. The
sixteen-year-old boy who won the second Quarter Quell
must have had people he loved--family, friends, a
sweetheart maybe--that he fought to get back to. Where are
they now? How is it that until Peeta and I were thrust upon
him, there was no one at all in his life? What did Snow do to
them?
"No," I say. "I want to go to the Capitol. I want to be part
of the rescue mission."
"They're gone," says Haymitch.
"How long ago did they leave? I could catch up. I could-
-" What? What could I do?
Haymitch shakes his head. "It'll never happen. You're
too valuable and too vulnerable. There was talk of sending
you to another district to divert the Capitol's attention while
the rescue takes place. But no one felt you could handle it."
"Please, Haymitch!" I'm begging now. "I have to do
something. I can't just sit here waiting to hear if they died.
There must be something I can do!"
"All right. Let me talk to Plutarch. You stay put." But I
can't. Haymitch's footsteps are still echoing in the outer hall
when I fumble my way through the slit in the dividing curtain
to find Finnick sprawled out on his stomach, his hands
twisted in his pillowcase. Although it's cowardly--cruel even-
-to rouse him from the shadowy, muted drug land to stark
reality, I go ahead and do it because I can't stand to face
this by myself.
As I explain our situation, his initial agitation
mysteriously ebbs. "Don't you see, Katniss, this will decide
things. One way or the other. By the end of the day, they'll
either be dead or with us. It's...it's more than we could hope
for!"
Well, that's a sunny view of our situation. And yet
there's something calming about the idea that this torment
could come to an end.
The curtain yanks back and there's Haymitch. He has a
job for us, if we can pull it together. They still need postbombing
footage of 13. "If we can get it in the next few
hours, Beetee can air it leading up to the rescue, and
maybe keep the Capitol's attention elsewhere."
"Yes, a distraction," says Finnick. "A decoy of sorts."
"What we really need is something so riveting that
even President Snow won't be able to tear himself away.
Got anything like that?" asks Haymitch.
Having a job that might help the mission snaps me into
focus. While I knock down breakfast and get prepped, I try
to think of what I might say. President Snow must be
wondering how that blood-splattered floor and his roses are
affecting me. If he wants me broken, then I will have to be
whole. But I don't think I will convince him of anything by
shouting a couple of defiant lines at the camera. Besides,
that won't buy the rescue team any time. Outbursts are
short. It's stories that take time.
I don't know if it will work, but when the television
crew's all assembled aboveground, I ask Cressida if she
could start out by asking me about Peeta. I take a seat on
the fallen marble pillar where I had my breakdown, wait for
the red light and Cressida's question.
"How did you meet Peeta?" she asks.
And then I do the thing that Haymitch has wanted since
my first interview. I open up. "When I met Peeta, I was
eleven years old, and I was almost dead." I talk about that
awful day when I tried to sell the baby clothes in the rain,
how Peeta's mother chased me from the bakery door, and
how he took a beating to bring me the loaves of bread that
saved our lives. "We had never even spoken. The first time
I ever talked to Peeta was on the train to the Games."
"But he was already in love with you," says Cressida.
"I guess so." I allow myself a small smile.
"How are you doing with the separation?" she asks.
"Not well. I know at any moment Snow could kill him.
Especially since he warned Thirteen about the bombing. It's
a terrible thing to live with," I say. "But because of what
they're putting him through, I don't have any reservations
anymore. About doing whatever it takes to destroy the
Capitol. I'm finally free." I turn my gaze skyward and watch
the flight of a hawk across the sky. "President Snow once
admitted to me that the Capitol was fragile. At the time, I
didn't know what he meant. It was hard to see clearly
because I was so afraid. Now I'm not. The Capitol's fragile
because it depends on the districts for everything. Food,
energy, even the Peacekeepers that police us. If we
declare our freedom, the Capitol collapses. President
Snow, thanks to you, I'm officially declaring mine today."
I've been sufficient, if not dazzling. Everyone loves the
bread story. But it's my message to President Snow that
gets the wheels spinning in Plutarch's brain. He hastily calls
Finnick and Haymitch over and they have a brief but intense
conversation that I can see Haymitch isn't happy with.
Plutarch seems to win--Finnick's pale but nodding his head
by the end of it.
As Finnick moves to take my seat before the camera,
Haymitch tells him, "You don't have to do this."
"Yes, I do. If it will help her." Finnick balls up his rope in
his hand. "I'm ready."
I don't know what to expect. A love story about Annie?
An account of the abuses in District 4? But Finnick Odair
takes a completely different tack.
"President Snow used to...sell me...my body, that is,"
Finnick begins in a flat, removed tone. "I wasn't the only
one. If a victor is considered desirable, the president gives
them as a reward or allows people to buy them for an
exorbitant amount of money. If you refuse, he kills someone
you love. So you do it."
That explains it, then. Finnick's parade of lovers in the
Capitol. They were never real lovers. Just people like our
old Head Peacekeeper, Cray, who bought desperate girls
to devour and discard because he could. I want to interrupt
the taping and beg Finnick's forgiveness for every false
thought I've ever had about him. But we have a job to do,
and I sense Finnick's role will be far more effective than
mine.
"I wasn't the only one, but I was the most popular," he
says. "And perhaps the most defenseless, because the
people I loved were so defenseless. To make themselves
feel better, my patrons would make presents of money or
jewelry, but I found a much more valuable form of payment."
Secrets, I think. That's what Finnick told me his lovers
paid him in, only I thought the whole arrangement was by
his choice.
"Secrets," he says, echoing my thoughts. "And this is
where you're going to want to stay tuned, President Snow,
because so very many of them were about you. But let's
begin with some of the others."
Finnick begins to weave a tapestry so rich in detail that
you can't doubt its authenticity. Tales of strange sexual
appetites, betrayals of the heart, bottomless greed, and
bloody power plays. Drunken secrets whispered over damp
pillow-cases in the dead of night. Finnick was someone
bought and sold. A district slave. A handsome one,
certainly, but in reality, harmless. Who would he tell? And
who would believe him if he did? But some secrets are too
delicious not to share. I don't know the people Finnick
names--all seem to be prominent Capitol citizens--but I
know, from listening to the chatter of my prep team, the
attention the most mild slip in judgment can draw. If a bad
haircut can lead to hours of gossip, what will charges of
incest, back-stabbing, blackmail, and arson produce? Even
as the waves of shock and recrimination roll over the
Capitol, the people there will be waiting, as I am now, to
hear about the president.
"And now, on to our good President Coriolanus
Snow," says Finnick. "Such a young man when he rose to
power. Such a clever one to keep it. How, you must ask
yourself, did he do it? One word. That's all you really need
to know. Poison." Finnick goes back to Snow's political
ascension, which I know nothing of, and works his way up to
the present, pointing out case after case of the mysterious
deaths of Snow's adversaries or, even worse, his allies
who had the potential to become threats. People dropping
dead at a feast or slowly, inexplicably declining into
shadows over a period of months. Blamed on bad shellfish,
elusive viruses, or an overlooked weakness in the aorta.
Snow drinking from the poisoned cup himself to deflect
suspicion. But antidotes don't always work. They say that's
why he wears the roses that reek of perfume. They say it's
to cover the scent of blood from the mouth sores that will
never heal. They say, they say, they say...Snow has a list
and no one knows who will be next.
Poison. The perfect weapon for a snake.
Since my opinion of the Capitol and its noble president
are already so low, I can't say Finnick's allegations shock
me. They seem to have far more effect on the displaced
Capitol rebels like my crew and Fulvia--even Plutarch
occasionally reacts in surprise, maybe wondering how a
specific tidbit passed him by. When Finnick finishes, they
just keep the cameras rolling until finally he has to be the
one to say "Cut."
The crew hurries inside to edit the material, and
Plutarch leads Finnick off for a chat, probably to see if he
has any more stories. I'm left with Haymitch in the rubble,
wondering if Finnick's fate would have one day been mine.
Why not? Snow could have gotten a really good price for
the girl on fire.
"Is that what happened to you?" I ask Haymitch.
"No. My mother and younger brother. My girl. They
were all dead two weeks after I was crowned victor.
Because of that stunt I pulled with the force field," he
answers. "Snow had no one to use against me."
"I'm surprised he didn't just kill you," I say.
"Oh, no. I was the example. The person to hold up to
the young Finnicks and Johannas and Cashmeres. Of what
could happen to a victor who caused problems," says
Haymitch. "But he knew he had no leverage against me."
"Until Peeta and I came along," I say softly. I don't even
get a shrug in return.
With our job done, there's nothing left for Finnick and
me to do but wait. We try to fill the dragging minutes in
Special Defense. Tie knots. Push our lunch around our
bowls. Blow things up on the shooting range. Because of
the danger of detection, no communication comes from the
rescue team. At 15:00, the designated hour, we stand
tense and silent in the back of a room full of screens and
computers and watch Beetee and his team try to dominate
the airwaves. His usual fidgety distraction is replaced with
a determination I have never seen. Most of my interview
doesn't make the cut, just enough to show I am alive and
still defiant. It is Finnick's salacious and gory account of the
Capitol that takes the day. Is Beetee's skill improving? Or
are his counterparts in the Capitol a little too fascinated to
want to tune Finnick out? For the next sixty minutes, the
Capitol feed alternates between the standard afternoon
newscast, Finnick, and attempts to black it all out. But the
rebel techno team manages to override even the latter and,
in a real coup, keeps control for almost the entire attack on
Snow.
"Let it go!" says Beetee, throwing up his hands,
relinquishing the broadcast back to the Capitol. He mops
his face with a cloth. "If they're not out of there by now,
they're all dead." He spins in his chair to see Finnick and
me reacting to his words. "It was a good plan, though. Did
Plutarch show it to you?"
Of course not. Beetee takes us to another room and
shows us how the team, with the help of rebel insiders, will
attempt--has attempted--to free the victors from an
underground prison. It seems to have involved knockout
gas distributed by the ventilation system, a power failure,
the detonation of a bomb in a government building several
miles from the prison, and now the disruption of the
broadcast. Beetee's glad we find the plan hard to follow,
because then our enemies will, too.
"Like your electricity trap in the arena?" I ask.
"Exactly. And see how well that worked out?" says
Beetee.
Well...not really, I think.
Finnick and I try to station ourselves in Command,
where surely first word of the rescue will come, but we are
barred because serious war business is being carried out.
We refuse to leave Special Defense and end up waiting in
the hummingbird room for news.
Making knots. Making knots. No word. Making knots.
Tick-tock. This is a clock. Do not think of Gale. Do not think
of Peeta. Making knots. We do not want dinner. Fingers
raw and bleeding. Finnick finally gives up and assumes the
hunched position he took in the arena when the jabberjays
attacked. I perfect my miniature noose. The words of "The
Hanging Tree" replay in my head. Gale and Peeta. Peeta
and Gale.
"Did you love Annie right away, Finnick?" I ask.
"No." A long time passes before he adds, "She crept
up on me."
I search my heart, but at the moment the only person I
can feel creeping up on me is Snow.
It must be midnight, it must be tomorrow when
Haymitch pushes open the door. "They're back. We're
wanted in the hospital." My mouth opens with a flood of
questions that he cuts off with "That's all I know."
I want to run, but Finnick's acting so strange, as if he's
lost the ability to move, so I take his hand and lead him like
a small child. Through Special Defense, into the elevator
that goes this way and that, and on to the hospital wing. The
place is in an uproar, with doctors shouting orders and the
wounded being wheeled through the halls in their beds.
We're sideswiped by a gurney bearing an
unconscious, emaciated young woman with a shaved head.
Her flesh shows bruises and oozing scabs. Johanna
Mason. Who actually knew rebel secrets. At least the one
about me. And this is how she has paid for it.
Through a doorway, I catch a glimpse of Gale, stripped
to the waist, perspiration streaming down his face as a
doctor removes something from under his shoulder blade
with a long pair of tweezers. Wounded, but alive. I call his
name, start toward him until a nurse pushes me back and
shuts me out.
"Finnick!" Something between a shriek and a cry of
joy. A lovely if somewhat bedraggled young woman--dark
tangled hair, sea green eyes--runs toward us in nothing but
a sheet. "Finnick!" And suddenly, it's as if there's no one in
the world but these two, crashing through space to reach
each other. They collide, enfold, lose their balance, and
slam against a wall, where they stay. Clinging into one
being. Indivisible.
A pang of jealousy hits me. Not for either Finnick or
Annie but for their certainty. No one seeing them could
doubt their love.
Boggs, looking a little worse for wear but uninjured,
finds Haymitch and me. "We got them all out. Except
Enobaria. But since she's from Two, we doubt she's being
held anyway. Peeta's at the end of the hall. The effects of
the gas are just wearing off. You should be there when he
wakes."
Peeta.
Alive and well--maybe not well but alive and here.
Away from Snow. Safe. Here. With me. In a minute I can
touch him. See his smile. Hear his laugh.
Haymitch's grinning at me. "Come on, then," he says.
I'm light-headed with giddiness. What will I say? Oh,
who cares what I say? Peeta will be ecstatic no matter what
I do. He'll probably be kissing me anyway. I wonder if it will
feel like those last kisses on the beach in the arena, the
ones I haven't dared let myself consider until this moment.
Peeta's awake already, sitting on the side of the bed,
looking bewildered as a trio of doctors reassure him, flash
lights in his eyes, check his pulse. I'm disappointed that
mine was not the first face he saw when he woke, but he
sees it now. His features register disbelief and something
more intense that I can't quite place. Desire? Desperation?
Surely both, for he sweeps the doctors aside, leaps to his
feet, and moves toward me. I run to meet him, my arms
extended to embrace him. His hands are reaching for me,
too, to caress my face, I think.
My lips are just forming his name when his fingers lock
around my throat.
13
The cold collar chafes my neck and makes the
shivering even harder to control. At least I am no longer in
the claustrophobic tube, while the machines click and whir
around me, listening to a disembodied voice telling me to
hold still while I try to convince myself I can still breathe.
Even now, when I've been assured there will be no
permanent damage, I hunger for air.
The medical team's main concerns--damage to my
spinal cord, airway, veins, and arteries--have been allayed.
Bruising, hoarseness, the sore larynx, this strange little
cough--not to be worried about. It will all be fine. The
Mockingjay will not lose her voice. Where, I want to ask, is
the doctor who determines if I am losing my mind? Only I'm
not supposed to talk right now. I can't even thank Boggs
when he comes to check on me. To look me over and tell
me he's seen a lot worse injuries among the soldiers when
they teach choke holds in training.
It was Boggs who knocked out Peeta with one blow
before any permanent damage could be done. I know
Haymitch would have come to my defense if he hadn't been
utterly unprepared. To catch both Haymitch and myself off
guard is a rare thing. But we have been so consumed with
saving Peeta, so tortured by having him in the Capitol's
hands, that the elation at having him back blinded us. If I'd
had a private reunion with Peeta, he would have killed me.
Now that he's deranged.
No, not deranged, I remind myself. Hijacked. That's
the word I heard pass between Plutarch and Haymitch as I
was wheeled past them in the hallway. Hijacked. I don't
know what it means.
Prim, who appeared moments after the attack and has
stayed as close to me as possible ever since, spreads
another blanket over me. "I think they'll take the collar off
soon, Katniss. You won't be so cold then." My mother,
who's been assisting in a complicated surgery, has still not
been informed of Peeta's assault. Prim takes one of my
hands, which is clutched in a fist, and massages it until it
opens and blood begins to flow through my fingers again.
She's starting on the second fist when the doctors show up,
remove the collar, and give me a shot of something for pain
and swelling. I lie, as instructed, with my head still, not
aggravating the injuries to my neck.
Plutarch, Haymitch, and Beetee have been waiting in
the hall for the doctors to give them clearance to see me. I
don't know if they've told Gale, but since he's not here, I
assume they haven't. Plutarch ushers the doctors out and
tries to order Prim to go as well, but she says, "No. If you
force me to leave, I'll go directly to surgery and tell my
mother everything that's happened. And I warn you, she
doesn't think much of a Gamemaker calling the shots on
Katniss's life. Especially when you've taken such poor care
of her."
Plutarch looks offended, but Haymitch chuckles. "I'd let
it go, Plutarch," he says. Prim stays.
"So, Katniss, Peeta's condition has come as a shock
to all of us," says Plutarch. "We couldn't help but notice his
deterioration in the last two interviews. Obviously, he'd
been abused, and we put his psychological state down to
that. Now we believe something more was going on. That
the Capitol has been subjecting him to a rather uncommon
technique known as hijacking. Beetee?"
"I'm sorry," Beetee says, "but I can't tell you all the
specifics of it, Katniss. The Capitol's very secretive about
this form of torture, and I believe the results are
inconsistent. This we do know. It's a type of fear
conditioning. The term hijack comes from an old English
word that means 'to capture,' or even better, 'seize.' We
believe it was chosen because the technique involves the
use of tracker jacker venom, and the jack suggested
hijack. You were stung in your first Hunger Games, so
unlike most of us, you have firsthand knowledge of the
effects of the venom."
Terror. Hallucinations. Nightmarish visions of losing
those I love. Because the venom targets the part of the
brain that houses fear.
"I'm sure you remember how frightening it was. Did you
also suffer mental confusion in the aftermath?" asks
Beetee. "A sense of being unable to judge what was true
and what was false? Most people who have been stung
and lived to tell about it report something of the kind."
Yes. That encounter with Peeta. Even after I was
clearheaded, I wasn't sure if he had saved my life by taking
on Cato or if I'd imagined it.
"Recall is made more difficult because memories can
be changed." Beetee taps his forehead. "Brought to the
forefront of your mind, altered, and saved again in the
revised form. Now imagine that I ask you to remember
something--either with a verbal suggestion or by making
you watch a tape of the event--and while that experience is
refreshed, I give you a dose of tracker jacker venom. Not
enough to induce a three-day blackout. Just enough to
infuse the memory with fear and doubt. And that's what your
brain puts in long-term storage."
I start to feel sick. Prim asks the question that's in my
mind. "Is that what they've done to Peeta? Taken his
memories of Katniss and distorted them so they're scary?"
Beetee nods. "So scary that he'd see her as lifethreatening.
That he might try to kill her. Yes, that's our
current theory."
I cover my face with my arms because this isn't
happening. It isn't possible. For someone to make Peeta
forget he loves me...no one could do that.
"But you can reverse it, right?" asks Prim.
"Um...very little data on that," says Plutarch. "None,
really. If hijacking rehabilitation has been attempted before,
we have no access to those records."
"Well, you're going to try, aren't you?" Prim persists.
"You're not just going to lock him up in some padded room
and leave him to suffer?"
"Of course, we'll try, Prim," says Beetee. "It's just, we
don't know to what degree we'll succeed. If any. My guess
is that fearful events are the hardest to root out. They're the
ones we naturally remember the best, after all."
"And apart from his memories of Katniss, we don't yet
know what else has been tampered with," says Plutarch.
"We're putting together a team of mental health and military
professionals to come up with a counterattack. I, personally,
feel optimistic that he'll make a full recovery."
"Do you?" asks Prim caustically. "And what do you
think, Haymitch?"
I shift my arms slightly so I can see his expression
through the crack. He's exhausted and discouraged as he
admits, "I think Peeta might get somewhat better. But...I
don't think he'll ever be the same." I snap my arms back
together, closing the crack, shutting them all out.
"At least he's alive," says Plutarch, as if he's losing
patience with the lot of us. "Snow executed Peeta's stylist
and his prep team on live television tonight. We've no idea
what happened to Effie Trinket. Peeta's damaged, but he's
here. With us. And that's a definite improvement over his
situation twelve hours ago. Let's keep that in mind, all
right?"
Plutarch's attempt to cheer me up--laced with the news
of another four, possibly five, murders--somehow backfires.
Portia. Peeta's prep team. Effie. The effort to fight back
tears makes my throat throb until I'm gasping again.
Eventually, they have no choice but to sedate me.
When I wake, I wonder if this will be the only way I
sleep now, with drugs shot into my arm. I'm glad I'm not
supposed to talk for the next few days, because there's
nothing I want to say. Or do. In fact, I'm a model patient, my
lethargy taken for restraint, obedience to the doctors'
orders. I no longer feel like crying. In fact, I can only manage
to hold on to one simple thought: an image of Snow's face
accompanied by the whisper in my head. I will kill you.
My mother and Prim take turns nursing me, coaxing
me to swallow bites of soft food. People come in
periodically to give me updates on Peeta's condition. The
high levels of tracker jacker venom are working their way
out of his body. He's being treated only by strangers,
natives of 13--no one from home or the Capitol has been
allowed to see him--to keep any dangerous memories from
triggering. A team of specialists works long hours
designing a strategy for his recovery.
Gale's not supposed to visit me, as he's confined to
bed with some kind of shoulder wound. But on the third
night, after I've been medicated and the lights turned down
low for bedtime, he slips silently into my room. He doesn't
speak, just runs his fingers over the bruises on my neck
with a touch as light as moth wings, plants a kiss between
my eyes, and disappears.
The next morning, I'm discharged from the hospital with
instructions to move quietly and speak only when
necessary. I'm not imprinted with a schedule, so I wander
around aimlessly until Prim's excused from her hospital
duties to take me to our family's latest compartment. 2212.
Identical to the last one, but with no window.
Buttercup has now been issued a daily food allowance
and a pan of sand that's kept under the bathroom sink. As
Prim tucks me into bed, he hops up on my pillow, vying for
her attention. She cradles him but stays focused on me.
"Katniss, I know this whole thing with Peeta is terrible for
you. But remember, Snow worked on him for weeks, and
we've only had him for a few days. There's a chance that
the old Peeta, the one who loves you, is still inside. Trying
to get back to you. Don't give up on him."
I look at my little sister and think how she has inherited
the best qualities our family has to offer: my mother's
healing hands, my father's level head, and my fight. There's
something else there as well, something entirely her own.
An ability to look into the confusing mess of life and see
things for what they are. Is it possible she could be right?
That Peeta could return to me?
"I have to get back to the hospital," Prim says, placing
Buttercup on the bed beside me. "You two keep each other
company, okay?"
Buttercup springs off the bed and follows her to the
door, complaining loudly when he's left behind. We're about
as much company for each other as dirt. After maybe thirty
seconds, I know I can't stand being confined in the
subterranean cell, and leave Buttercup to his own devices. I
get lost several times, but eventually I make my way down
to Special Defense. Everyone I pass stares at the bruises,
and I can't help feeling self-conscious to the point that I tug
my collar up to my ears.
Gale must have been released from the hospital this
morning as well, because I find him in one of the research
rooms with Beetee. They're immersed, heads bent over a
drawing, taking a measurement. Versions of the picture
litter the table and floor. Tacked on the corkboard walls and
occupying several computer screens are other designs of
some sort. In the rough lines of one, I recognize Gale's
twitch-up snare. "What are these?" I ask hoarsely, pulling
their attention from the sheet.
"Ah, Katniss, you've found us out," says Beetee
cheerfully.
"What? Is this a secret?" I know Gale's been down
here working with Beetee a lot, but I assumed they were
messing around with bows and guns.
"Not really. But I've felt a little guilty about it. Stealing
Gale away from you so much," Beetee admits.
Since I've spent most of my time in 13 disoriented,
worried, angry, being remade, or hospitalized, I can't say
Gale's absences have inconvenienced me. Things haven't
been exactly harmonious between us, either. But I let
Beetee think he owes me. "I hope you've been putting his
time to good use."
"Come and see," he says, waving me over to a
computer screen.
This is what they've been doing. Taking the
fundamental ideas behind Gale's traps and adapting them
into weapons against humans. Bombs mostly. It's less
about the mechanics of the traps than the psychology
behind them. Booby-trapping an area that provides
something essential to survival. A water or food supply.
Frightening prey so that a large number flee into a greater
destruction. Endangering off-spring in order to draw in the
actual desired target, the parent. Luring the victim into what
appears to be a safe haven--where death awaits it. At
some point, Gale and Beetee left the wilderness behind
and focused on more human impulses. Like compassion. A
bomb explodes. Time is allowed for people to rush to the
aid of the wounded. Then a second, more powerful bomb
kills them as well.
"That seems to be crossing some kind of line," I say.
"So anything goes?" They both stare at me--Beetee with
doubt, Gale with hostility. "I guess there isn't a rule book for
what might be unacceptable to do to another human being."
"Sure there is. Beetee and I have been following the
same rule book President Snow used when he hijacked
Peeta," says Gale.
Cruel, but to the point. I leave without further comment. I
feel if I don't get outside immediately, I'll just go ballistic, but
I'm still in Special Defense when I'm waylaid by Haymitch.
"Come on," he says. "We need you back up at the
hospital."
"What for?" I ask.
"They're going to try something on Peeta," he answers.
"Send in the most innocuous person from Twelve they can
come up with. Find someone Peeta might share childhood
memories with, but nothing too close to you. They're
screening people now."
I know this will be a difficult task, since anyone Peeta
shares childhood memories with would most likely be from
town, and almost none of those people escaped the
flames. But when we reach the hospital room that has been
turned into a work space for Peeta's recovery team, there
she sits chatting with Plutarch. Delly Cartwright. As always,
she gives me a smile that suggests I'm her best friend in
the world. She gives this smile to everyone. "Katniss!" she
calls out.
"Hey, Delly," I say. I'd heard she and her younger
brother had survived. Her parents, who ran the shoe shop in
town, weren't as lucky. She looks older, wearing the drab
13 clothes that flatter no one, with her long yellow hair in a
practical braid instead of curls. Delly's a bit thinner than I
remember, but she was one of the few kids in District 12
with a couple of pounds to spare. The diet here, the stress,
the grief of losing her parents have all, no doubt,
contributed. "How are you doing?" I ask.
"Oh, it's been a lot of changes all at once." Her eyes fill
with tears. "But everyone's really nice here in Thirteen, don't
you think?"
Delly means it. She genuinely likes people. All people,
not just a select few she's spent years making up her mind
about.
"They've made an effort to make us feel welcome," I
say. I think that's a fair statement without going overboard.
"Are you the one they've picked to see Peeta?"
"I guess so. Poor Peeta. Poor you. I'll never
understand the Capitol," she says.
"Better not to, maybe," I tell her.
"Delly's known Peeta for a long time," says Plutarch.
"Oh, yes!" Delly's face brightens. "We played together
from when we were little. I used to tell people he was my
brother."
"What do you think?" Haymitch asks me. "Anything that
might trigger memories of you?"
"We were all in the same class. But we never
overlapped much," I say.
"Katniss was always so amazing, I never dreamed she
would notice me," says Delly. "The way she could hunt and
go in the Hob and everything. Everyone admired her so."
Haymitch and I both have to take a hard look at her
face to double-check if she's joking. To hear Delly describe
it, I had next to no friends because I intimidated people by
being so exceptional. Not true. I had next to no friends
because I wasn't friendly. Leave it to Delly to spin me into
something wonderful.
"Delly always thinks the best of everyone," I explain. "I
don't think Peeta could have bad memories associated
with her." Then I remember. "Wait. In the Capitol. When I
lied about recognizing the Avox girl. Peeta covered for me
and said she looked like Delly."
"I remember," says Haymitch. "But I don't know. It
wasn't true. Delly wasn't actually there. I don't think it can
compete with years of childhood memories."
"Especially with such a pleasant companion as Delly,"
says Plutarch. "Let's give it a shot."
Plutarch, Haymitch, and I go to the observation room
next to where Peeta's confined. It's crowded with ten
members of his recovery team armed with pens and
clipboards. The one-way glass and audio setup allow us to
watch Peeta secretly. He lies on the bed, his arms
strapped down. He doesn't fight the restraints, but his
hands fidget continuously. His expression seems more
lucid than when he tried to strangle me, but it's still not one
that belongs to him.
When the door quietly opens, his eyes widen in alarm,
then become confused. Delly crosses the room tentatively,
but as she nears him she naturally breaks into a smile.
"Peeta? It's Delly. From home."
"Delly?" Some of the clouds seem to clear. "Delly. It's
you."
"Yes!" she says with obvious relief. "How do you feel?"
"Awful. Where are we? What's happened?" asks
Peeta.
"Here we go," says Haymitch.
"I told her to steer clear of any mention of Katniss or
the Capitol," says Plutarch. "Just see how much of home
she could conjure up."
"Well...we're in District Thirteen. We live here now,"
says Delly.
"That's what those people have been saying. But it
makes no sense. Why aren't we home?" asks Peeta.
Delly bites her lip. "There was...an accident. I miss
home badly, too. I was only just thinking about those chalk
drawings we used to do on the paving stones. Yours were
so wonderful. Remember when you made each one a
different animal?"
"Yeah. Pigs and cats and things," says Peeta. "You
said...about an accident?"
I can see the sheen of sweat on Delly's forehead as
she tries to work around the question. "It was bad. No
one...could stay," she says haltingly.
"Hang in there, girl," says Haymitch.
"But I know you're going to like it here, Peeta. The
people have been really nice to us. There's always food
and clean clothes, and school's much more interesting,"
says Delly.
"Why hasn't my family come to see me?" Peeta asks.
"They can't." Delly's tearing up again. "A lot of people
didn't get out of Twelve. So we'll need to make a new life
here. I'm sure they could use a good baker. Do you
remember when your father used to let us make dough girls
and boys?"
"There was a fire," Peeta says suddenly.
"Yes," she whispers.
"Twelve burned down, didn't it? Because of her," says
Peeta angrily. "Because of Katniss!" He begins to pull on
the restraints.
"Oh, no, Peeta. It wasn't her fault," says Delly.
"Did she tell you that?" he hisses at her.
"Get her out of there," says Plutarch. The door opens
immediately and Delly begins to back toward it slowly.
"She didn't have to. I was--" Delly begins.
"Because she's lying! She's a liar! You can't believe
anything she says! She's some kind of mutt the Capitol
created to use against the rest of us!" Peeta shouts.
"No, Peeta. She's not a--" Delly tries again.
"Don't trust her, Delly," says Peeta in a frantic voice. "I
did, and she tried to kill me. She killed my friends. My
family. Don't even go near her! She's a mutt!"
A hand reaches through the doorway, pulls Delly out,
and the door swings shut. But Peeta keeps yelling. "A mutt!
She's a stinking mutt!"
Not only does he hate me and want to kill me, he no
longer believes I'm human. It was less painful being
strangled.
Around me the recovery team members scribble like
crazy, taking down every word. Haymitch and Plutarch grab
my arms and propel me out of the room. They lean me up
against a wall in the silent hallway. But I know Peeta
continues to scream behind the door and the glass.
Prim was wrong. Peeta is irretrievable. "I can't stay
here anymore," I say numbly. "If you want me to be the
Mockingjay, you'll have to send me away."
"Where do you want to go?" asks Haymitch.
"The Capitol." It's the only place I can think of where I
have a job to do.
"Can't do it," Plutarch says. "Not until all the districts
are secure. Good news is, the fighting's almost over in all of
them but Two. It's a tough nut to crack, though."
That's right. First the districts. Next the Capitol. And
then I hunt down Snow.
"Fine," I say. "Send me to Two."
14
District 2 is a large district, as one might expect,
composed of a series of villages spread across the
mountains. Each was originally associated with a mine or
quarry, although now, many are devoted to the housing and
training of Peacekeepers. None of this would present much
of a challenge, since the rebels have 13's airpower on their
side, except for one thing: At the center of the district is a
virtually impenetrable mountain that houses the heart of the
Capitol's military.
We've nicknamed the mountain the Nut since I relayed
Plutarch's "tough nut to crack" comment to the weary and
discouraged rebel leaders here. The Nut was established
directly after the Dark Days, when the Capitol had lost 13
and was desperate for a new underground stronghold. They
had some of their military resources situated on the
outskirts of the Capitol itself--nuclear missiles, aircraft,
troops--but a significant chunk of their power was now
under an enemy's control. Of course, there was no way they
could hope to replicate 13, which was the work of centuries.
However, in the old mines of nearby District 2, they saw
opportunity. From the air, the Nut appeared to be just
another mountain with a few entrances on its faces. But
inside were vast cavernous spaces where slabs of stones
had been cut, hauled to the surface, and transported down
slippery narrow roads to make distant buildings. There was
even a train system to facilitate transporting the miners
from the Nut to the very center of the main town in District 2.
It ran right to the square that Peeta and I visited during the
Victory Tour, standing on the wide marble steps of the
Justice Building, trying not to look too closely at Cato's and
Clove's grieving families assembled below us.
It was not the most ideal terrain, plagued as it was by
mudslides, floods, and avalanches. But the advantages
outweighed the concerns. As they'd cut deep into the
mountain, the miners had left large pillars and walls of stone
to support the infrastructure. The Capitol reinforced these
and set about making the mountain their new military base.
Filling it with computer banks and meeting rooms, barracks
and arsenals. Widening entrances to allow the exit of
hovercraft from the hangar, installing missile launchers. But
on the whole, leaving the exterior of the mountain largely
unchanged. A rough, rocky tangle of trees and wildlife. A
natural fortress to protect them from their enemies.
By the other districts' standards, the Capitol babied
the inhabitants here. Just by looking at the District 2 rebels,
you can tell they were decently fed and cared for in
childhood. Some did end up as quarry and mine workers.
Others were educated for jobs in the Nut or funneled into
the ranks of Peacekeepers. Trained young and hard for
combat. The Hunger Games were an opportunity for wealth
and a kind of glory not seen elsewhere. Of course, the
people of 2 swallowed the Capitol's propaganda more
easily than the rest of us. Embraced their ways. But for all
that, at the end of the day, they were still slaves. And if that
was lost on the citizens who became Peacekeepers or
worked in the Nut, it was not lost on the stonecutters who
formed the backbone of the resistance here.
Things stand as they did when I arrived two weeks
ago. The outer villages are in rebel hands, the town divided,
and the Nut is as untouchable as ever. Its few entrances
heavily fortified, its heart safely enfolded in the mountain.
While every other district has now wrested control from the
Capitol, 2 remains in its pocket.
Each day, I do whatever I can to help. Visit the
wounded. Tape short propos with my camera crew. I'm not
allowed in actual combat, but they invite me to the meetings
on the status of the war, which is a lot more than they did in
13. It's much better here. Freer, no schedules on my arm,
fewer demands on my time. I live aboveground in the rebel
villages or surrounding caves. For safety's sake, I'm
relocated often. During the day, I've been given clearance
to hunt as long as I take a guard along and don't stray too
far. In the thin, cold mountain air, I feel some physical
strength returning, my mind clearing away the rest of the
fogginess. But with this mental clarity comes an even
sharper awareness of what has been done to Peeta.
Snow has stolen him from me, twisted him beyond
recognition, and made me a present of him. Boggs, who
came to 2 when I did, told me that even with all the plotting,
it was a little too easy to rescue Peeta. He believes if 13
hadn't made the effort, Peeta would've been delivered to
me anyway. Dropped off in an actively warring district or
perhaps 13 itself. Tied up with ribbons and tagged with my
name. Programmed to murder me.
It's only now that he's been corrupted that I can fully
appreciate the real Peeta. Even more than I would've if he'd
died. The kindness, the steadiness, the warmth that had an
unexpected heat behind it. Outside of Prim, my mother, and
Gale, how many people in the world love me
unconditionally? I think in my case, the answer may now be
none. Sometimes when I'm alone, I take the pearl from
where it lives in my pocket and try to remember the boy with
the bread, the strong arms that warded off nightmares on
the train, the kisses in the arena. To make myself put a
name to the thing I've lost. But what's the use? It's gone.
He's gone. Whatever existed between us is gone. All that's
left is my promise to kill Snow. I tell myself this ten times a
day.
Back in 13, Peeta's rehabilitation continues. Even
though I don't ask, Plutarch gives me cheerful updates on
the phone like "Good news, Katniss! I think we've almost
got him convinced you're not a mutt!" Or "Today he was
allowed to feed himself pudding!"
When Haymitch gets on after, he admits Peeta's no
better. The only dubious ray of hope has come from my
sister. "Prim came up with the idea of trying to hijack him
back," Haymitch tells me. "Bring up the distorted memories
of you and then give him a big dose of a calming drug, like
morphling. We've only tried it on one memory. The tape of
the two of you in the cave, when you told him that story
about getting Prim the goat."
"Any improvement?" I ask.
"Well, if extreme confusion is an improvement over
extreme terror, then yes," says Haymitch. "But I'm not sure it
is. He lost the ability to speak for several hours. Went into
some sort of stupor. When he came out, the only thing he
asked about was the goat."
"Right," I say.
"How's it out there?" he asks.
"No forward motion," I tell him.
"We're sending out a team to help with the mountain.
Beetee and some of the others," he says. "You know, the
brains."
When the brains are selected, I'm not surprised to see
Gale's name on the list. I thought Beetee would bring him,
not for his technological expertise, but in the hopes that he
could somehow think of a way to ensnare a mountain.
Originally, Gale offered to come with me to 2, but I could
see I was tearing him away from his work with Beetee. I told
him to sit tight and stay where he was most needed. I didn't
tell him his presence would make it even more difficult for
me to mourn Peeta.
Gale finds me when they arrive late one afternoon. I'm
sitting on a log at the edge of my current village, plucking a
goose. A dozen or so of the birds are piled at my feet.
Great flocks of them have been migrating through here
since I've arrived, and the pickings are easy. Without a
word, Gale settles beside me and begins to relieve a bird
of its feathers. We're through about half when he says, "Any
chance we'll get to eat these?"
"Yeah. Most go to the camp kitchen, but they expect
me to give a couple to whoever I'm staying with tonight," I
say. "For keeping me."
"Isn't the honor of the thing enough?" he says.
"You'd think," I reply. "But word's gotten out that
mockingjays are hazardous to your health."
We pluck in silence for a while longer. Then he says, "I
saw Peeta yesterday. Through the glass."
"What'd you think?" I ask.
"Something selfish," says Gale.
"That you don't have to be jealous of him anymore?"
My fingers give a yank, and a cloud of feathers floats down
around us.
"No. Just the opposite." Gale pulls a feather out of my
hair. "I thought...I'll never compete with that. No matter how
much pain I'm in." He spins the feather between his thumb
and forefinger. "I don't stand a chance if he doesn't get
better. You'll never be able to let him go. You'll always feel
wrong about being with me."
"The way I always felt wrong kissing him because of
you," I say.
Gale holds my gaze. "If I thought that was true, I could
almost live with the rest of it."
"It is true," I admit. "But so is what you said about
Peeta."
Gale makes a sound of exasperation. Nonetheless,
after we've dropped off the birds and volunteered to go
back to the woods to gather kindling for the evening fire, I
find myself wrapped in his arms. His lips brushing the faded
bruises on my neck, working their way to my mouth.
Despite what I feel for Peeta, this is when I accept deep
down that he'll never come back to me. Or I'll never go back
to him. I'll stay in 2 until it falls, go to the Capitol and kill
Snow, and then die for my trouble. And he'll die insane and
hating me. So in the fading light I shut my eyes and kiss
Gale to make up for all the kisses I've withheld, and
because it doesn't matter anymore, and because I'm so
desperately lonely I can't stand it.
Gale's touch and taste and heat remind me that at
least my body's still alive, and for the moment it's a
welcome feeling. I empty my mind and let the sensations
run through my flesh, happy to lose myself. When Gale pulls
away slightly, I move forward to close the gap, but I feel his
hand under my chin. "Katniss," he says. The instant I open
my eyes, the world seems disjointed. This is not our woods
or our mountains or our way. My hand automatically goes to
the scar on my left temple, which I associate with confusion.
"Now kiss me." Bewildered, unblinking, I stand there while
he leans in and presses his lips to mine briefly. He
examines my face closely. "What's going on in your head?"
"I don't know," I whisper back.
"Then it's like kissing someone who's drunk. It doesn't
count," he says with a weak attempt at a laugh. He scoops
up a pile of kindling and drops it in my empty arms,
returning me to myself.
"How do you know?" I say, mostly to cover my
embarrassment. "Have you kissed someone who's drunk?"
I guess Gale could've been kissing girls right and left back
in 12. He certainly had enough takers. I never thought about
it much before.
He just shakes his head. "No. But it's not hard to
imagine."
"So, you never kissed any other girls?" I ask.
"I didn't say that. You know, you were only twelve when
we met. And a real pain besides. I did have a life outside of
hunting with you," he says, loading up with firewood.
Suddenly, I'm genuinely curious. "Who did you kiss?
And where?"
"Too many to remember. Behind the school, on the
slag heap, you name it," he says.
I roll my eyes. "So when did I become so special?
When they carted me off to the Capitol?"
"No. About six months before that. Right after New
Year's. We were in the Hob, eating some slop of Greasy
Sae's. And Darius was teasing you about trading a rabbit
for one of his kisses. And I realized...I minded," he tells me.
I remember that day. Bitter cold and dark by four in the
afternoon. We'd been hunting, but a heavy snow had driven
us back into town. The Hob was crowded with people
looking for refuge from the weather. Greasy Sae's soup,
made with stock from the bones of a wild dog we'd shot a
week earlier, was below her usual standards. Still, it was
hot, and I was starving as I scooped it up, sitting crosslegged
on her counter. Darius was leaning on the post of
the stall, tickling my cheek with the end of my braid, while I
smacked his hand away. He was explaining why one of his
kisses merited a rabbit, or possibly two, since everyone
knows redheaded men are the most virile. And Greasy Sae
and I were laughing because he was so ridiculous and
persistent and kept pointing out women around the Hob
who he said had paid far more than a rabbit to enjoy his
lips. "See? The one in the green muffler? Go ahead and
ask her. If you need a reference."
A million miles from here, a billion days ago, this
happened. "Darius was just joking around," I say.
"Probably. Although you'd be the last to figure out if he
wasn't," Gale tells me. "Take Peeta. Take me. Or even
Finnick. I was starting to worry he had his eye on you, but
he seems back on track now."
"You don't know Finnick if you think he'd love me," I
say.
Gale shrugs. "I know he was desperate. That makes
people do all kinds of crazy things."
I can't help thinking that's directed at me.
Bright and early the next morning, the brains assemble
to take on the problem of the Nut. I'm asked to the meeting,
although I don't have much to contribute. I avoid the
conference table and perch in the wide windowsill that has
a view of the mountain in question. The commander from 2,
a middle-aged woman named Lyme, takes us on a virtual
tour of the Nut, its interior and fortifications, and recounts
the failed attempts to seize it. I've crossed paths with her
briefly a couple of times since my arrival, and was dogged
by the feeling I'd met her before. She's memorable enough,
standing over six feet tall and heavily muscled. But it's only
when I see a clip of her in the field, leading a raid on the
main entrance of the Nut, that something clicks and I realize
I'm in the presence of another victor. Lyme, the tribute from
District 2, who won her Hunger Games over a generation
ago. Effie sent us her tape, among others, to prepare for
the Quarter Quell. I've probably caught glimpses of her
during the Games over the years, but she's kept a low
profile. With my newfound knowledge of Haymitch's and
Finnick's treatment, all I can think is: What did the Capitol
do to her after she won?
When Lyme finishes the presentation, the questions
from the brains begin. Hours pass, and lunch comes and
goes, as they try to come up with a realistic plan for taking
the Nut. But while Beetee thinks he might be able to
override certain computer systems, and there's some
discussion of putting the handful of internal spies to use, no
one has any really innovative thoughts. As the afternoon
wears on, talk keeps returning to a strategy that has been
tried repeatedly--the storming of the entrances. I can see
Lyme's frustration building because so many variations of
this plan have already failed, so many of her soldiers have
been lost. Finally, she bursts out, "The next person who
suggests we take the entrances better have a brilliant way
to do it, because you're going to be the one leading that
mission!"
Gale, who is too restless to sit at the table for more
than a few hours, has been alternating between pacing and
sharing my windowsill. Early on, he seemed to accept
Lyme's assertion that the entrances couldn't be taken, and
dropped out of the conversation entirely. For the last hour or
so, he's sat quietly, his brow knitted in concentration,
staring at the Nut through the window glass. In the silence
that follows Lyme's ultimatum, he speaks up. "Is it really so
necessary that we take the Nut? Or would it be enough to
disable it?"
"That would be a step in the right direction," says
Beetee. "What do you have in mind?"
"Think of it as a wild dog den," Gale continues. "You're
not going to fight your way in. So you have two choices.
Trap the dogs inside or flush them out."
"We've tried bombing the entrances," says Lyme.
"They're set too far inside the stone for any real damage to
be done."
"I wasn't thinking of that," says Gale. "I was thinking of
using the mountain." Beetee rises and joins Gale at the
window, peering through his ill-fitting glasses. "See?
Running down the sides?"
"Avalanche paths," says Beetee under his breath. "It'd
be tricky. We'd have to design the detonation sequence
with great care, and once it's in motion, we couldn't hope to
control it."
"We don't need to control it if we give up the idea that
we have to possess the Nut," says Gale. "Only shut it
down."
"So you're suggesting we start avalanches and block
the entrances?" asks Lyme.
"That's it," says Gale. "Trap the enemy inside, cut off
from supplies. Make it impossible for them to send out their
hovercraft."
While everyone considers the plan, Boggs flips
through a stack of blueprints of the Nut and frowns. "You
risk killing everyone inside. Look at the ventilation system.
It's rudimentary at best. Nothing like what we have in
Thirteen. It depends entirely on pumping in air from the
mountainsides. Block those vents and you'll suffocate
whoever is trapped."
"They could still escape through the train tunnel to the
square," says Beetee.
"Not if we blow it up," says Gale brusquely. His intent,
his full intent, becomes clear. Gale has no interest in
preserving the lives of those in the Nut. No interest in
caging the prey for later use.
This is one of his death traps.
15
The implications of what Gale is suggesting settle
quietly around the room. You can see the reaction playing
out on people's faces. The expressions range from
pleasure to distress, from sorrow to satisfaction.
"The majority of the workers are citizens from Two,"
says Beetee neutrally.
"So what?" says Gale. "We'll never be able to trust
them again."
"They should at least have a chance to surrender,"
says Lyme.
"Well, that's a luxury we weren't given when they firebombed
Twelve, but you're all so much cozier with the
Capitol here," says Gale. By the look on Lyme's face, I think
she might shoot him, or at least take a swing. She'd
probably have the upper hand, too, with all her training. But
her anger only seems to infuriate him and he yells, "We
watched children burn to death and there was nothing we
could do!"
I have to close my eyes a minute, as the image rips
through me. It has the desired effect. I want everyone in that
mountain dead. Am about to say so. But then...I'm also a
girl from District 12. Not President Snow. I can't help it. I
can't condemn someone to the death he's suggesting.
"Gale," I say, taking his arm and trying to speak in a
reasonable tone. "The Nut's an old mine. It'd be like
causing a massive coal mining accident." Surely the words
are enough to make anyone from 12 think twice about the
plan.
"But not so quick as the one that killed our fathers," he
retorts. "Is that everyone's problem? That our enemies
might have a few hours to reflect on the fact that they're
dying, instead of just being blown to bits?"
Back in the old days, when we were nothing more than
a couple of kids hunting outside of 12, Gale said things like
this and worse. But then they were just words. Here, put into
practice, they become deeds that can never be reversed.
"You don't know how those District Two people ended
up in the Nut," I say. "They may have been coerced. They
may be held against their will. Some are our own spies. Will
you kill them, too?"
"I would sacrifice a few, yes, to take out the rest of
them," he replies. "And if I were a spy in there, I'd say,
'Bring on the avalanches!'"
I know he's telling the truth. That Gale would sacrifice
his life in this way for the cause--no one doubts it. Perhaps
we'd all do the same if we were the spies and given the
choice. I guess I would. But it's a coldhearted decision to
make for other people and those who love them.
"You said we had two choices," Boggs tells him. "To
trap them or to flush them out. I say we try to avalanche the
mountain but leave the train tunnel alone. People can
escape into the square, where we'll be waiting for them."
"Heavily armed, I hope," says Gale. "You can be sure
they'll be."
"Heavily armed. We'll take them prisoner," agrees
Boggs.
"Let's bring Thirteen into the loop now," Beetee
suggests. "Let President Coin weigh in."
"She'll want to block the tunnel," says Gale with
conviction.
"Yes, most likely. But you know, Peeta did have a point
in his propos. About the dangers of killing ourselves off. I've
been playing with some numbers. Factoring in the
casualties and the wounded and...I think it's at least worth a
conversation," says Beetee.
Only a handful of people are invited to be part of that
conversation. Gale and I are released with the rest. I take
him hunting so he can blow off some steam, but he's not
talking about it. Probably too angry with me for countering
him.
The call does happen, a decision is made, and by
evening I'm suited up in my Mockingjay outfit, with my bow
slung over my shoulder and an earpiece that connects me
to Haymitch in 13--just in case a good opportunity for a
propo arises. We wait on the roof of the Justice Building
with a clear view of our target.
Our hoverplanes are initially ignored by the
commanders in the Nut, because in the past they've been
little more trouble than flies buzzing around a honeypot. But
after two rounds of bombings in the higher elevations of the
mountain, the planes have their attention. By the time the
Capitol's antiaircraft weapons begin to fire, it's already too
late.
Gale's plan exceeds anyone's expectations. Beetee
was right about being unable to control the avalanches
once they'd been set in motion. The mountainsides are
naturally unstable, but weakened by the explosions, they
seem almost fluid. Whole sections of the Nut collapse
before our eyes, obliterating any sign that human beings
have ever set foot on the place. We stand speechless, tiny
and insignificant, as waves of stone thunder down the
mountain. Burying the entrances under tons of rock. Raising
a cloud of dirt and debris that blackens the sky. Turning the
Nut into a tomb.
I imagine the hell inside the mountain. Sirens wailing.
Lights flickering into darkness. Stone dust choking the air.
The shrieks of panicked, trapped beings stumbling madly
for a way out, only to find the entrances, the launchpad, the
ventilation shafts themselves clogged with earth and rock
trying to force its way in. Live wires flung free, fires breaking
out, rubble making a familiar path a maze. People
slamming, shoving, scrambling like ants as the hill presses
in, threatening to crush their fragile shells.
"Katniss?" Haymitch's voice is in my earpiece. I try to
answer back and find both of my hands are clamped tightly
over my mouth. "Katniss!"
On the day my father died, the sirens went off during
my school lunch. No one waited for dismissal, or was
expected to. The response to a mine accident was
something outside the control of even the Capitol. I ran to
Prim's class. I still remember her, tiny at seven, very pale,
but sitting straight up with her hands folded on her desk.
Waiting for me to collect her as I'd promised I would if the
sirens ever sounded. She sprang out of her seat, grabbed
my coat sleeve, and we wove through the streams of
people pouring out onto the streets to pool at the main
entrance of the mine. We found our mother clenching the
rope that had been hastily strung to keep the crowd back. In
retrospect, I guess I should have known there was a
problem right then. Because why were we looking for her,
when the reverse should have been true?
The elevators were screeching, burning up and down
their cables as they vomited smoke-blackened miners into
the light of day. With each group came cries of relief,
relatives diving under the rope to lead off their husbands,
wives, children, parents, siblings. We stood in the freezing
air as the afternoon turned overcast, a light snow dusted the
earth. The elevators moved more slowly now and
disgorged fewer beings. I knelt on the ground and pressed
my hands into the cinders, wanting so badly to pull my
father free. If there's a more helpless feeling than trying to
reach someone you love who's trapped underground, I don't
know it. The wounded. The bodies. The waiting through the
night. Blankets put around your shoulders by strangers. A
mug of something hot that you don't drink. And then finally,
at dawn, the grieved expression on the face of the mine
captain that could only mean one thing.
What did we just do?
"Katniss! Are you there?" Haymitch is probably
making plans to have me fitted for a head shackle at this
very moment.
I drop my hands. "Yes."
"Get inside. Just in case the Capitol tries to retaliate
with what's left of its air force," he instructs.
"Yes," I repeat. Everyone on the roof, except for the
soldiers manning the machine guns, begin to make their
way inside. As I descend the stairs, I can't help brushing my
fingers along the unblemished white marble walls. So cold
and beautiful. Even in the Capitol, there's nothing to match
the magnificence of this old building. But there is no give to
the surface--only my flesh yields, my warmth taken. Stone
conquers people every time.
I sit at the base of one of the gigantic pillars in the
great entrance hall. Through the doors I can see the white
expanse of marble that leads to the steps on the square. I
remember how sick I was the day Peeta and I accepted
congratulations there for winning the Games. Worn down by
the Victory Tour, failing in my attempt to calm the districts,
facing the memories of Clove and Cato, particularly Cato's
gruesome, slow death by mutts.
Boggs crouches down beside me, his skin pale in the
shadows. "We didn't bomb the train tunnel, you know.
Some of them will probably get out."
"And then we'll shoot them when they show their
faces?" I ask.
"Only if we have to," he answers.
"We could send in trains ourselves. Help evacuate the
wounded," I say.
"No. It was decided to leave the tunnel in their hands.
That way they can use all the tracks to bring people out,"
says Boggs. "Besides, it will give us time to get the rest of
our soldiers to the square."
A few hours ago, the square was a no-man's-land, the
front line of the fight between the rebels and the
Peacekeepers. When Coin gave approval for Gale's plan,
the rebels launched a heated attack and drove the Capitol
forces back several blocks so that we would control the
train station in the event that the Nut fell. Well, it's fallen. The
reality has sunk in. Any survivors will escape to the square. I
can hear the gunfire starting again, as the Peacekeepers
are no doubt trying to fight their way in to rescue their
comrades. Our own soldiers are being brought in to counter
this.
"You're cold," says Boggs. "I'll see if I can find a
blanket." He goes before I can protest. I don't want a
blanket, even if the marble continues to leech my body heat.
"Katniss," says Haymitch in my ear.
"Still here," I answer.
"Interesting turn of events with Peeta this afternoon.
Thought you'd want to know," he says. Interesting isn't
good. It isn't better. But I don't really have any choice but to
listen. "We showed him that clip of you singing 'The
Hanging Tree.' It was never aired, so the Capitol couldn't
use it when he was being hijacked. He says he recognized
the song."
For a moment, my heart skips a beat. Then I realize it's
just more tracker jacker serum confusion. "He couldn't,
Haymitch. He never heard me sing that song."
"Not you. Your father. He heard him singing it one day
when he came to trade at the bakery. Peeta was small,
probably six or seven, but he remembered it because he
was specially listening to see if the birds stopped singing,"
says Haymitch. "Guess they did."
Six or seven. That would have been before my mother
banned the song. Maybe even right around the time I was
learning it. "Was I there, too?"
"Don't think so. No mention of you anyway. But it's the
first connection to you that hasn't triggered some mental
meltdown," says Haymitch. "It's something, at least,
Katniss."
My father. He seems to be everywhere today. Dying in
the mine. Singing his way into Peeta's muddled
consciousness. Flickering in the look Boggs gives me as
he protectively wraps the blanket around my shoulders. I
miss him so badly it hurts.
The gunfire's really picking up outside. Gale hurries by
with a group of rebels, eagerly headed for the battle. I don't
petition to join the fighters, not that they would let me. I have
no stomach for it anyway, no heat in my blood. I wish Peeta
was here--the old Peeta--because he would be able to
articulate why it is so wrong to be exchanging fire when
people, any people, are trying to claw their way out of the
mountain. Or is my own history making me too sensitive?
Aren't we at war? Isn't this just another way to kill our
enemies?
Night falls quickly. Huge, bright spotlights are turned
on, illuminating the square. Every bulb must be burning at
full wattage inside the train station as well. Even from my
position across the square, I can see clearly through the
plate-glass front of the long, narrow building. It would be
impossible to miss the arrival of a train, or even a single
person. But hours pass and no one comes. With each
minute, it becomes harder to imagine that anyone survived
the assault on the Nut.
It's well after midnight when Cressida comes to attach
a special microphone to my costume. "What's this for?" I
ask.
Haymitch's voice comes on to explain. "I know you're
not going to like this, but we need you to make a speech."
"A speech?" I say, immediately feeling queasy.
"I'll feed it to you, line by line," he assures me. "You'll
just have to repeat what I say. Look, there's no sign of life
from that mountain. We've won, but the fighting's continuing.
So we thought if you went out on the steps of the Justice
Building and laid it out--told everybody that the Nut's
defeated, that the Capitol's presence in District Two is
finished--you might be able to get the rest of their forces to
surrender."
I peer at the darkness beyond the square. "I can't even
see their forces."
"That's what the mike's for," he says. "You'll be
broadcast, both your voice through their emergency audio
system, and your image wherever people have access to a
screen."
I know there are a couple of huge screens here on the
square. I saw them on the Victory Tour. It might work, if I
were good at this sort of thing. Which I'm not. They tried to
feed me lines in those early experiments with the propos,
too, and it was a flop.
"You could save a lot of lives, Katniss," Haymitch says
finally.
"All right. I'll give it a try," I tell him.
It's strange standing outside at the top of the stairs,
fully costumed, brightly lit, but with no visible audience to
deliver my speech to. Like I'm doing a show for the moon.
"Let's make this quick," says Haymitch. "You're too
exposed."
My television crew, positioned out in the square with
special cameras, indicates that they're ready. I tell
Haymitch to go ahead, then click on my mike and listen
carefully to him dictate the first line of the speech. A huge
image of me lights up one of the screens over the square
as I begin. "People of District Two, this is Katniss
Everdeen speaking to you from the steps of your Justice
Building, where--"
The pair of trains comes screeching into the train
station side by side. As the doors slide open, people
tumble out in a cloud of smoke they've brought from the Nut.
They must have had at least an inkling of what would await
them at the square, because you can see them trying to act
evasively. Most of them flatten on the floor, and a spray of
bullets inside the station takes out the lights. They've come
armed, as Gale predicted, but they've come wounded as
well. The moans can be heard in the otherwise silent night
air.
Someone kills the lights on the stairs, leaving me in the
protection of shadow. A flame blooms inside the station--
one of the trains must actually be on fire--and a thick, black
smoke billows against the windows. Left with no choice, the
people begin to push out into the square, choking but
defiantly waving their guns. My eyes dart around the
rooftops that ring the square. Every one of them has been
fortified with rebel-manned machine gun nests. Moonlight
glints off oiled barrels.
A young man staggers out from the station, one hand
pressed against a bloody cloth at his cheek, the other
dragging a gun. When he trips and falls to his face, I see
the scorch marks down the back of his shirt, the red flesh
beneath. And suddenly, he's just another burn victim from a
mine accident.
My feet fly down the steps and I take off running for
him. "Stop!" I yell at the rebels. "Hold your fire!" The words
echo around the square and beyond as the mike amplifies
my voice. "Stop!" I'm nearing the young man, reaching
down to help him, when he drags himself up to his knees
and trains his gun on my head.
I instinctively back up a few steps, raise my bow over
my head to show my intention was harmless. Now that he
has both hands on his gun, I notice the ragged hole in his
cheek where something--falling stone maybe--punctured
the flesh. He smells of burning things, hair and meat and
fuel. His eyes are crazed with pain and fear.
"Freeze," Haymitch's voice whispers in my ear. I follow
his order, realizing that this is what all of District 2, all of
Panem maybe, must be seeing at the moment. The
Mockingjay at the mercy of a man with nothing to lose.
His garbled speech is barely comprehensible. "Give
me one reason I shouldn't shoot you."
The rest of the world recedes. There's only me looking
into the wretched eyes of the man from the Nut who asks for
one reason. Surely I should be able to come up with
thousands. But the words that make it to my lips are "I
can't."
Logically, the next thing that should happen is the man
pulling the trigger. But he's perplexed, trying to make sense
of my words. I experience my own confusion as I realize
what I've said is entirely true, and the noble impulse that
carried me across the square is replaced by despair. "I
can't. That's the problem, isn't it?" I lower my bow. "We blew
up your mine. You burned my district to the ground. We've
got every reason to kill each other. So do it. Make the
Capitol happy. I'm done killing their slaves for them." I drop
my bow on the ground and give it a nudge with my boot. It
slides across the stone and comes to rest at his knees.
"I'm not their slave," the man mutters.
"I am," I say. "That's why I killed Cato...and he killed
Thresh...and he killed Clove...and she tried to kill me. It just
goes around and around, and who wins? Not us. Not the
districts. Always the Capitol. But I'm tired of being a piece
in their Games."
Peeta. On the rooftop the night before our first Hunger
Games. He understood it all before we'd even set foot in
the arena. I hope he's watching now, that he remembers
that night as it happened, and maybe forgives me when I
die.
"Keep talking. Tell them about watching the mountain
go down," Haymitch insists.
"When I saw that mountain fall tonight, I
thought...they've done it again. Got me to kill you--the
people in the districts. But why did I do it? District Twelve
and District Two have no fight except the one the Capitol
gave us." The young man blinks at me uncomprehendingly.
I sink on my knees before him, my voice low and urgent.
"And why are you fighting with the rebels on the rooftops?
With Lyme, who was your victor? With people who were
your neighbors, maybe even your family?"
"I don't know," says the man. But he doesn't take his
gun off me.
I rise and turn slowly in a circle, addressing the
machine guns. "And you up there? I come from a mining
town. Since when do miners condemn other miners to that
kind of death, and then stand by to kill whoever manages to
crawl from the rubble?"
"Who is the enemy?" whispers Haymitch.
"These people"--I indicate the wounded bodies on the
square--"are not your enemy!" I whip back around to the
train station. "The rebels are not your enemy! We all have
one enemy, and it's the Capitol! This is our chance to put
an end to their power, but we need every district person to
do it!" The cameras are tight on me as I reach out my hands
to the man, to the wounded, to the reluctant rebels across
Panem. "Please! Join us!"
My words hang in the air. I look to the screen, hoping to
see them recording some wave of reconciliation going
through the crowd.
Instead I watch myself get shot on television.
16
"Always."
In the twilight of morphling, Peeta whispers the word
and I go searching for him. It's a gauzy, violet-tinted world,
with no hard edges, and many places to hide. I push
through cloud banks, follow faint tracks, catch the scent of
cinnamon, of dill. Once I feel his hand on my cheek and try
to trap it, but it dissolves like mist through my fingers.
When I finally begin to surface into the sterile hospital
room in 13, I remember. I was under the influence of sleep
syrup. My heel had been injured after I'd climbed out on a
branch over the electric fence and dropped back into 12.
Peeta had put me to bed and I had asked him to stay with
me as I was drifting off. He had whispered something I
couldn't quite catch. But some part of my brain had trapped
his single word of reply and let it swim up through my
dreams to taunt me now. "Always."
Morphling dulls the extremes of all emotions, so
instead of a stab of sorrow, I merely feel emptiness. A
hollow of dead brush where flowers used to bloom.
Unfortunately, there's not enough of the drug left in my veins
for me to ignore the pain in the left side of my body. That's
where the bullet hit. My hands fumble over the thick
bandages encasing my ribs and I wonder what I'm still
doing here.
It wasn't him, the man kneeling before me on the
square, the burned one from the Nut. He didn't pull the
trigger. It was someone farther back in the crowd. There
was less a sense of penetration than the feeling that I'd
been struck with a sledgehammer. Everything after the
moment of impact is confusion riddled with gunfire. I try to
sit up, but the only thing I manage is a moan.
The white curtain that divides my bed from the next
patient's whips back, and Johanna Mason stares down at
me. At first I feel threatened, because she attacked me in
the arena. I have to remind myself that she did it to save my
life. It was part of the rebel plot. But still, that doesn't mean
she doesn't despise me. Maybe her treatment of me was
all an act for the Capitol?
"I'm alive," I say rustily.
"No kidding, brainless." Johanna walks over and
plunks down on my bed, sending spikes of pain shooting
across my chest. When she grins at my discomfort, I know
we're not in for some warm reunion scene. "Still a little
sore?" With an expert hand, she quickly detaches the
morphling drip from my arm and plugs it into a socket taped
into the crook of her own. "They started cutting back my
supply a few days ago. Afraid I'm going to turn into one of
those freaks from Six. I've had to borrow from you when the
coast was clear. Didn't think you'd mind."
Mind? How can I mind when she was almost tortured
to death by Snow after the Quarter Quell? I have no right to
mind, and she knows it.
Johanna sighs as the morphling enters her
bloodstream. "Maybe they were onto something in Six.
Drug yourself out and paint flowers on your body. Not such
a bad life. Seemed happier than the rest of us, anyway."
In the weeks since I left 13, she's gained some weight
back. A soft down of hair has sprouted on her shaved head,
helping to hide some of the scars. But if she's siphoning off
my morphling, she's struggling.
"They've got this head doctor who comes around every
day. Supposed to be helping me recover. Like some guy
who's spent his life in this rabbit warren's going to fix me
up. Complete idiot. At least twenty times a session he
reminds me that I'm totally safe." I manage a smile. It's a
truly stupid thing to say, especially to a victor. As if such a
state of being ever existed, anywhere, for anyone. "How
about you, Mockingjay? You feel totally safe?"
"Oh, yeah. Right up until I got shot," I say.
"Please. That bullet never even touched you. Cinna
saw to that," she says.
I think of the layers of protective armor in my
Mockingjay outfit. But the pain came from somewhere.
"Broken ribs?"
"Not even. Bruised pretty good. The impact ruptured
your spleen. They couldn't repair it." She gives a dismissive
wave of her hand. "Don't worry, you don't need one. And if
you did, they'd find you one, wouldn't they? It's everybody's
job to keep you alive."
"Is that why you hate me?" I ask.
"Partly," she admits. "Jealousy is certainly involved. I
also think you're a little hard to swallow. With your tacky
romantic drama and your defender-of-the-helpless act. Only
it isn't an act, which makes you more unbearable. Please
feel free to take this personally."
"You should have been the Mockingjay. No one
would've had to feed you lines," I say.
"True. But no one likes me," she tells me.
"They trusted you, though. To get me out," I remind her.
"And they're afraid of you."
"Here, maybe. In the Capitol, you're the one they're
scared of now." Gale appears in the doorway, and Johanna
neatly unhooks herself and reattaches me to the morphling
drip. "Your cousin's not afraid of me," she says
confidentially. She scoots off my bed and crosses to the
door, nudging Gale's leg with her hip as she passes him.
"Are you, gorgeous?" We can hear her laughter as she
disappears down the hall.
I raise my eyebrows at him as he takes my hand.
"Terrified," he mouths. I laugh, but it turns into a wince.
"Easy." He strokes my face as the pain ebbs. "You've got
to stop running straight into trouble."
"I know. But someone blew up a mountain," I answer.
Instead of pulling back, he leans in closer, searching
my face. "You think I'm heartless."
"I know you're not. But I won't tell you it's okay," I say.
Now he draws back, almost impatiently. "Katniss, what
difference is there, really, between crushing our enemy in a
mine or blowing them out of the sky with one of Beetee's
arrows? The result is the same."
"I don't know. We were under attack in Eight, for one
thing. The hospital was under attack," I say.
"Yes, and those hoverplanes came from District Two,"
he says. "So, by taking them out, we prevented further
attacks."
"But that kind of thinking...you could turn it into an
argument for killing anyone at any time. You could justify
sending kids into the Hunger Games to prevent the districts
from getting out of line," I say.
"I don't buy that," he tells me.
"I do," I reply. "It must be those trips to the arena."
"Fine. We know how to disagree," he says. "We
always have. Maybe it's good. Between you and me, we've
got District Two now."
"Really?" For a moment a feeling of triumph flares up
inside me. Then I think about the people on the square.
"Was there fighting after I was shot?"
"Not much. The workers from the Nut turned on the
Capitol soldiers. The rebels just sat by and watched," he
says. "Actually, the whole country just sat by and watched."
"Well, that's what they do best," I say.
You'd think that losing a major organ would entitle you
to lie around a few weeks, but for some reason, my doctors
want me up and moving almost immediately. Even with the
morphling, the internal pain's severe the first few days, but
then it slacks off considerably. The soreness from the
bruised ribs, however, promises to hang on for a while. I
begin to resent Johanna dipping into my morphling supply,
but I still let her take whatever she likes.
Rumors of my death have been running rampant, so
they send in the team to film me in my hospital bed. I show
off my stitches and impressive bruising and congratulate
the districts on their successful battle for unity. Then I warn
the Capitol to expect us soon.
As part of my rehabilitation, I take short walks
aboveground each day. One afternoon, Plutarch joins me
and gives me an update on our current situation. Now that
District 2 has allied with us, the rebels are taking a breather
from the war to regroup. Fortifying supply lines, seeing to
the wounded, reorganizing their troops. The Capitol, like 13
during the Dark Days, finds itself completely cut off from
outside help as it holds the threat of nuclear attack over its
enemies. Unlike 13, the Capitol is not in a position to
reinvent itself and become self-sufficient.
"Oh, the city might be able to scrape along for a while,"
says Plutarch. "Certainly, there are emergency supplies
stockpiled. But the significant difference between Thirteen
and the Capitol are the expectations of the populace.
Thirteen was used to hardship, whereas in the Capitol, all
they've known is Panem et Circenses."
"What's that?" I recognize Panem, of course, but the
rest is nonsense.
"It's a saying from thousands of years ago, written in a
language called Latin about a place called Rome," he
explains. "Panem et Circenses translates into 'Bread and
Circuses.' The writer was saying that in return for full bellies
and entertainment, his people had given up their political
responsibilities and therefore their power."
I think about the Capitol. The excess of food. And the
ultimate entertainment. The Hunger Games. "So that's what
the districts are for. To provide the bread and circuses."
"Yes. And as long as that kept rolling in, the Capitol
could control its little empire. Right now, it can provide
neither, at least at the standard the people are accustomed
to," says Plutarch. "We have the food and I'm about to
orchestrate an entertainment propo that's sure to be
popular. After all, everybody loves a wedding."
I freeze in my tracks, sick at the idea of what he's
suggesting. Somehow staging some perverse wedding
between Peeta and me. I haven't been able to face that
one-way glass since I've been back and, at my own
request, only get updates about Peeta's condition from
Haymitch. He speaks very little about it. Different
techniques are being tried. There will never truly be a way
to cure him. And now they want me to marry Peeta for a
propo?
Plutarch rushes to reassure me. "Oh, no, Katniss. Not
your wedding. Finnick and Annie's. All you need to do is
show up and pretend to be happy for them."
"That's one of the few things I won't have to pretend,
Plutarch," I tell him.
The next few days bring a flurry of activity as the event
is planned. The differences between the Capitol and 13 are
thrown into sharp relief by the event. When Coin says
"wedding," she means two people signing a piece of paper
and being assigned a new compartment. Plutarch means
hundreds of people dressed in finery at a three-day
celebration. It's amusing to watch them haggle over the
details. Plutarch has to fight for every guest, every musical
note. After Coin vetoes a dinner, entertainment, and
alcohol, Plutarch yells, "What's the point of the propo if no
one's having any fun!"
It's hard to put a Gamemaker on a budget. But even a
quiet celebration causes a stir in 13, where they seem to
have no holidays at all. When it's announced that children
are wanted to sing District 4's wedding song, practically
every kid shows up. There's no shortage of volunteers to
help make decorations. In the dining hall, people chat
excitedly about the event.
Maybe it's more than the festivities. Maybe it's that we
are all so starved for something good to happen that we
want to be part of it. It would explain why--when Plutarch has
a fit over what the bride will wear--I volunteer to take Annie
back to my house in 12, where Cinna left a variety of
evening clothes in a big storage closet downstairs. All of
the wedding gowns he designed for me went back to the
Capitol, but there are some dresses I wore on the Victory
Tour. I'm a little leery about being with Annie since all I really
know about her is that Finnick loves her and everybody
thinks she's mad. On the hovercraft ride, I decide she's less
mad than unstable. She laughs at odd places in the
conversation or drops out of it distractedly. Those green
eyes fixate on a point with such intensity that you find
yourself trying to make out what she sees in the empty air.
Sometimes, for no reason, she presses both her hands
over her ears as if to block out a painful sound. All right,
she's strange, but if Finnick loves her, that's good enough
for me.
I got permission for my prep team to come along, so
I'm relieved of having to make any fashion decisions. When
I open the closet, we all fall silent because Cinna's
presence is so strong in the flow of the fabrics. Then
Octavia drops to her knees, rubs the hem of a skirt against
her cheek, and bursts into tears. "It's been so long," she
gasps, "since I've seen anything pretty."
Despite reservations on Coin's side that it's too
extravagant, and on Plutarch's side that it's too drab, the
wedding is a smash hit. The three hundred lucky guests
culled from 13 and the many refugees wear their everyday
clothes, the decorations are made from autumn foliage, the
music is provided by a choir of children accompanied by
the lone fiddler who made it out of 12 with his instrument.
So it's simple, frugal by the Capitol's standards. It doesn't
matter because nothing can compete with the beauty of the
couple. It isn't about their borrowed finery--Annie wears a
green silk dress I wore in 5, Finnick one of Peeta's suits
that they altered--although the clothes are striking. Who can
look past the radiant faces of two people for whom this day
was once a virtual impossibility? Dalton, the cattle guy from
10, conducts the ceremony, since it's similar to the one
used in his district. But there are unique touches of District
4. A net woven from long grass that covers the couple
during their vows, the touching of each other's lips with salt
water, and the ancient wedding song, which likens
marriage to a sea voyage.
No, I don't have to pretend to be happy for them.
After the kiss that seals the union, the cheers, and a
toast with apple cider, the fiddler strikes up a tune that turns
every head from 12. We may have been the smallest,
poorest district in Panem, but we know how to dance.
Nothing has been officially scheduled at this point, but
Plutarch, who's calling the propo from the control room,
must have his fingers crossed. Sure enough, Greasy Sae
grabs Gale by the hand and pulls him into the center of the
floor and faces off with him. People pour in to join them,
forming two long lines. And the dancing begins.
I'm standing off to the side, clapping to the rhythm,
when a bony hand pinches me above the elbow. Johanna
scowls at me. "Are you going to miss the chance to let
Snow see you dancing?" She's right. What could spell
victory louder than a happy Mockingjay twirling around to
music? I find Prim in the crowd. Since winter evenings gave
us a lot of time to practice, we're actually pretty good
partners. I brush off her concerns about my ribs, and we
take our places in the line. It hurts, but the satisfaction of
having Snow watch me dance with my little sister reduces
other feelings to dust.
Dancing transforms us. We teach the steps to the
District 13 guests. Insist on a special number for the bride
and groom. Join hands and make a giant, spinning circle
where people show off their footwork. Nothing silly, joyful, or
fun has happened in so long. This could go on all night if not
for the last event planned in Plutarch's propo. One I hadn't
heard about, but then it was meant to be a surprise.
Four people wheel out a huge wedding cake from a
side room. Most of the guests back up, making way for this
rarity, this dazzling creation with blue-green, white-tipped
icing waves swimming with fish and sailboats, seals and
sea flowers. But I push my way through the crowd to confirm
what I knew at first sight. As surely as the embroidery
stitches in Annie's gown were done by Cinna's hand, the
frosted flowers on the cake were done by Peeta's.
This may seem like a small thing, but it speaks
volumes. Haymitch has been keeping a great deal from
me. The boy I last saw, screaming his head off, trying to
tear free of his restraints, could never have made this.
Never have had the focus, kept his hands steady, designed
something so perfect for Finnick and Annie. As if
anticipating my reaction, Haymitch is at my side.
"Let's you and me have a talk," he says.
Out in the hall, away from the cameras, I ask, "What's
happening to him?"
Haymitch shakes his head. "I don't know. None of us
knows. Sometimes he's almost rational, and then, for no
reason, he goes off again. Doing the cake was a kind of
therapy. He's been working on it for days. Watching
him...he seemed almost like before."
"So, he's got the run of the place?" I ask. The idea
makes me nervous on about five different levels.
"Oh, no. He frosted under heavy guard. He's still under
lock and key. But I've talked to him," Haymitch says.
"Face-to-face?" I ask. "And he didn't go nuts?"
"No. Pretty angry with me, but for all the right reasons.
Not telling him about the rebel plot and whatnot." Haymitch
pauses a moment, as if deciding something. "He says he'd
like to see you."
I'm on a frosting sailboat, tossed around by blue-green
waves, the deck shifting beneath my feet. My palms press
into the wall to steady myself. This wasn't part of the plan. I
wrote Peeta off in 2. Then I was to go to the Capitol, kill
Snow, and get taken out myself. The gunshot was only a
temporary setback. Never was I supposed to hear the
words He says he'd like to see you. But now that I have,
there's no way to refuse.
At midnight, I'm standing outside the door to his cell.
Hospital room. We had to wait for Plutarch to finish getting
his wedding footage, which, despite the lack of what he
calls razzle-dazzle, he's pleased with. "The best thing about
the Capitol basically ignoring Twelve all these years is that
you people still have a little spontaneity. The audience eats
that up. Like when Peeta announced he was in love with
you or you did the trick with the berries. Makes for good
television."
I wish I could meet with Peeta privately. But the
audience of doctors has assembled behind the one-way
glass, clipboards ready, pens poised. When Haymitch
gives me the okay in my earpiece, I slowly open the door.
Those blue eyes lock on me instantly. He's got three
restraints on each arm, and a tube that can dispense a
knockout drug just in case he loses control. He doesn't fight
to free himself, though, only observes me with the wary look
of someone who still hasn't ruled out that he's in the
presence of a mutt. I walk over until I'm standing about a
yard from the bed. There's nothing to do with my hands, so I
cross my arms protectively over my ribs before I speak.
"Hey."
"Hey," he responds. It's like his voice, almost his voice,
except there's something new in it. An edge of suspicion
and reproach.
"Haymitch said you wanted to talk to me," I say.
"Look at you, for starters." It's like he's waiting for me
to transform into a hybrid drooling wolf right before his
eyes. He stares so long I find myself casting furtive glances
at the one-way glass, hoping for some direction from
Haymitch, but my earpiece stays silent. "You're not very big,
are you? Or particularly pretty?"
I know he's been through hell and back, and yet
somehow the observation rubs me the wrong way. "Well,
you've looked better."
Haymitch's advice to back off gets muffled by Peeta's
laughter. "And not even remotely nice. To say that to me
after all I've been through."
"Yeah. We've all been through a lot. And you're the one
who was known for being nice. Not me." I'm doing
everything wrong. I don't know why I feel so defensive. He's
been tortured! He's been hijacked! What's wrong with me?
Suddenly, I think I might start screaming at him--I'm not even
sure about what--so I decide to get out of there. "Look, I
don't feel so well. Maybe I'll drop by tomorrow."
I've just reached the door when his voice stops me.
"Katniss. I remember about the bread."
The bread. Our one moment of real connection before
the Hunger Games.
"They showed you the tape of me talking about it," I
say.
"No. Is there a tape of you talking about it? Why didn't
the Capitol use it against me?" he asks.
"I made it the day you were rescued," I answer. The
pain in my chest wraps around my ribs like a vise. The
dancing was a mistake. "So what do you remember?"
"You. In the rain," he says softly. "Digging in our trash
bins. Burning the bread. My mother hitting me. Taking the
bread out for the pig but then giving it to you instead."
"That's it. That's what happened," I say. "The next day,
after school, I wanted to thank you. But I didn't know how."
"We were outside at the end of the day. I tried to catch
your eye. You looked away. And then...for some reason, I
think you picked a dandelion." I nod. He does remember. I
have never spoken about that moment aloud. "I must have
loved you a lot."
"You did." My voice catches and I pretend to cough.
"And did you love me?" he asks.
I keep my eyes on the tiled floor. "Everyone says I did.
Everyone says that's why Snow had you tortured. To break
me."
"That's not an answer," he tells me. "I don't know what
to think when they show me some of the tapes. In that first
arena, it looked like you tried to kill me with those tracker
jackers."
"I was trying to kill all of you," I say. "You had me treed."
"Later, there's a lot of kissing. Didn't seem very
genuine on your part. Did you like kissing me?" he asks.
"Sometimes," I admit. "You know people are watching
us now?"
"I know. What about Gale?" he continues.
My anger's returning. I don't care about his recovery--
this isn't the business of the people behind the glass. "He's
not a bad kisser either," I say shortly.
"And it was okay with both of us? You kissing the
other?" he asks.
"No. It wasn't okay with either of you. But I wasn't
asking your permission," I tell him.
Peeta laughs again, coldly, dismissively. "Well, you're
a piece of work, aren't you?"
Haymitch doesn't protest when I walk out. Down the
hall. Through the beehive of compartments. Find a warm
pipe to hide behind in a laundry room. It takes a long time
before I get to the bottom of why I'm so upset. When I do,
it's almost too mortifying to admit. All those months of
taking it for granted that Peeta thought I was wonderful are
over. Finally, he can see me for who I really am. Violent.
Distrustful. Manipulative. Deadly.
And I hate him for it.
17
Blindsided. That's how I feel when Haymitch tells me in
the hospital. I fly down the steps to Command, mind racing
a mile a minute, and burst right into a war meeting.
"What do you mean, I'm not going to the Capitol? I
have to go! I'm the Mockingjay!" I say.
Coin barely looks up from her screen. "And as the
Mockingjay, your primary goal of unifying the districts
against the Capitol has been achieved. Don't worry--if it
goes well, we'll fly you in for the surrender."
The surrender?
"That'll be too late! I'll miss all the fighting. You need
me--I'm the best shot you've got!" I shout. I don't usually
brag about this, but it's got to be at least close to true.
"Gale's going."
"Gale has shown up for training every day unless
occupied with other approved duties. We feel confident he
can manage himself in the field," says Coin. "How many
training sessions do you estimate you've attended?"
None. That's how many. "Well, sometimes I was
hunting. And...I trained with Beetee down in Special
Weaponry."
"It's not the same, Katniss," says Boggs. "We all know
you're smart and brave and a good shot. But we need
soldiers in the field. You don't know the first thing about
executing orders, and you're not exactly at your physical
peak."
"That didn't bother you when I was in Eight. Or Two, for
that matter," I counter.
"You weren't originally authorized for combat in either
case," says Plutarch, shooting me a look that signals I'm
about to reveal too much.
No, the bomber battle in 8 and my intervention in 2
were spontaneous, rash, and definitely unauthorized.
"And both resulted in your injury," Boggs reminds me.
Suddenly, I see myself through his eyes. A smallish
seventeen-year-old girl who can't quite catch her breath
since her ribs haven't fully healed. Disheveled.
Undisciplined. Recuperating. Not a soldier, but someone
who needs to be looked after.
"But I have to go," I say.
"Why?" asks Coin.
I can't very well say it's so I can carry out my own
personal vendetta against Snow. Or that the idea of
remaining here in 13 with the latest version of Peeta while
Gale goes off to fight is unbearable. But I have no shortage
of reasons to want to fight in the Capitol. "Because of
Twelve. Because they destroyed my district."
The president thinks about this a moment. Considers
me. "Well, you have three weeks. It's not long, but you can
begin training. If the Assignment Board deems you fit,
possibly your case will be reviewed."
That's it. That's the most I can hope for. I guess it's my
own fault. I did blow off my schedule every single day unless
something suited me. It didn't seem like much of a priority,
jogging around a field with a gun with so many other things
going on. And now I'm paying for my negligence.
Back in the hospital, I find Johanna in the same
circumstance and spitting mad. I tell her about what Coin
said. "Maybe you can train, too."
"Fine. I'll train. But I'm going to the stinking Capitol if I
have to kill a crew and fly there myself," says Johanna.
"Probably best not to bring that up in training," I say.
"But it's nice to know I'll have a ride."
Johanna grins, and I feel a slight but significant shift in
our relationship. I don't know that we're actually friends, but
possibly the word allies would be accurate. That's good. I'm
going to need an ally.
The next morning, when we report for training at 7:30,
reality slaps me in the face. We've been funneled into a
class of relative beginners, fourteen- or fifteen-year-olds,
which seems a little insulting until it's obvious that they're in
far better condition than we are. Gale and the other people
already chosen to go to the Capitol are in a different,
accelerated phase of training. After we stretch--which hurts-
-there's a couple of hours of strengthening exercises--which
hurt--and a five-mile run--which kills. Even with Johanna's
motivational insults driving me on, I have to drop out after a
mile.
"It's my ribs," I explain to the trainer, a no-nonsense
middle-aged woman we're supposed to address as
Soldier York. "They're still bruised."
"Well, I'll tell you, Soldier Everdeen, those are going to
take at least another month to heal up on their own," she
says.I shake my head. "I don't have a month."
She looks me up and down. "The doctors haven't
offered you any treatment?"
"Is there a treatment?" I ask. "They said they had to
mend naturally."
"That's what they say. But they could speed up the
process if I recommend it. I warn you, though, it isn't any
fun," she tells me.
"Please. I've got to get to the Capitol," I say.
Soldier York doesn't question this. She scribbles
something on a pad and sends me directly back to the
hospital. I hesitate. I don't want to miss any more training.
"I'll be back for the afternoon session," I promise. She just
purses her lips.
Twenty-four needle jabs to my rib cage later, I'm
flattened out on my hospital bed, gritting my teeth to keep
from begging them to bring back my morphling drip. It's
been by my bed so I can take a hit as needed. I haven't
used it lately, but I kept it for Johanna's sake. Today they
tested my blood to make sure it was clean of the painkiller,
as the mixture of the two drugs--the morphling and
whatever's set my ribs on fire--has dangerous side effects.
They made it clear I would have a difficult couple of days.
But I told them to go ahead.
It's a bad night in our room. Sleep's out of the question.
I think I can actually smell the ring of flesh around my chest
burning, and Johanna's fighting off withdrawal symptoms.
Early on, when I apologize about cutting off her morphling
supply, she waves it off, saying it had to happen anyway.
But by three in the morning, I'm the target of every colorful
bit of profanity District 7 has to offer. At dawn, she drags
me out of bed, determined to get to training.
"I don't think I can do it," I confess.
"You can do it. We both can. We're victors,
remember? We're the ones who can survive anything they
throw at us," she snarls at me. She's a sick greenish color,
shaking like a leaf. I get dressed.
We must be victors to make it through the morning. I
think I'm going to lose Johanna when we realize it's pouring
outside. Her face turns ashen and she seems to have
ceased breathing.
"It's just water. It won't kill us," I say. She clenches her
jaw and stomps out into the mud. Rain drenches us as we
work our bodies and then slog around the running course. I
bail after a mile again, and I have to resist the temptation to
take off my shirt so the cold water can sizzle off my ribs. I
force down my field lunch of soggy fish and beet stew.
Johanna gets halfway through her bowl before it comes
back up. In the afternoon, we learn to assemble our guns. I
manage it, but Johanna can't hold her hands steady enough
to fit the parts together. When York's back is turned, I help
her out. Even though the rain continues, the afternoon's an
improvement because we're on the shooting range. At last,
something I'm good at. It takes some adjusting from a bow
to a gun, but by the end of the day, I've got the best score in
my class.
We're just inside the hospital doors when Johanna
declares, "This has to stop. Us living in the hospital.
Everyone views us as patients."
It's not a problem for me. I can move into our family
compartment, but Johanna's never been assigned one.
When she tries to get discharged from the hospital, they
won't agree to let her live alone, even if she comes in for
daily talks with the head doctor. I think they may have put
two and two together about the morphling and this only
adds to their view that she's unstable. "She won't be alone.
I'm going to room with her," I announce. There's some
dissent, but Haymitch takes our part, and by bedtime, we
have a compartment across from Prim and my mother, who
agrees to keep an eye on us.
After I take a shower, and Johanna sort of wipes
herself down with a damp cloth, she makes a cursory
inspection of the place. When she opens the drawer that
holds my few possessions, she shuts it quickly. "Sorry."
I think how there's nothing in Johanna's drawer but her
government-issued clothes. That she doesn't have one
thing in the world to call her own. "It's okay. You can look at
my stuff if you want."
Johanna unlatches my locket, studying the pictures of
Gale, Prim, and my mother. She opens the silver parachute
and pulls out the spile and slips it onto her pinkie. "Makes
me thirsty just looking at it." Then she finds the pearl Peeta
gave me. "Is this--?"
"Yeah," I say. "Made it through somehow." I don't want
to talk about Peeta. One of the best things about training is,
it keeps me from thinking of him.
"Haymitch says he's getting better," she says.
"Maybe. But he's changed," I say.
"So have you. So have I. And Finnick and Haymitch
and Beetee. Don't get me started on Annie Cresta. The
arena messed us all up pretty good, don't you think? Or do
you still feel like the girl who volunteered for your sister?"
she asks me.
"No," I answer.
"That's the one thing I think my head doctor might be
right about. There's no going back. So we might as well get
on with things." She neatly returns my keepsakes to the
drawer and climbs into the bed across from me just as the
lights go out. "You're not afraid I'll kill you tonight?"
"Like I couldn't take you," I answer. Then we laugh,
since both our bodies are so wrecked, it will be a miracle if
we can get up the next day. But we do. Each morning, we
do. And by the end of the week, my ribs feel almost like
new, and Johanna can assemble her rifle without help.
Soldier York gives the pair of us an approving nod as
we knock off for the day. "Fine job, Soldiers."
When we move out of hearing, Johanna mutters, "I
think winning the Games was easier." But the look on her
face says she's pleased.
In fact, we're almost in good spirits when we go to the
dining hall, where Gale's waiting to eat with me. Receiving
a giant serving of beef stew doesn't hurt my mood either.
"First shipments of food arrived this morning," Greasy Sae
tells me. "That's real beef, from District Ten. Not any of your
wild dog."
"Don't remember you turning it down," Gale tosses
back. We join a group that includes Delly, Annie, and
Finnick. It's something to see Finnick's transformation since
his marriage. His earlier incarnations--the decadent Capitol
heartthrob I met before the Quell, the enigmatic ally in the
arena, the broken young man who tried to help me hold it
together--these have been replaced by someone who
radiates life. Finnick's real charms of self-effacing humor
and an easygoing nature are on display for the first time.
He never lets go of Annie's hand. Not when they walk, not
when they eat. I doubt he ever plans to. She's lost in some
daze of happiness. There are still moments when you can
tell something slips in her brain and another world blinds
her to us. But a few words from Finnick call her back.
Delly, who I've known since I was little but never gave
much thought to, has grown in my estimation. She was told
what Peeta said to me that night after the wedding, but
she's not a gossip. Haymitch says she's the best defender I
have when Peeta goes off on some kind of tear about me.
Always taking my side, blaming his negative perceptions
on the Capitol's torture. She has more influence on him than
any of the others do, because he really does know her.
Anyway, even if she's sugarcoating my good points, I
appreciate it. Frankly, I could use a little sugarcoating.
I'm starving and the stew is so delicious--beef,
potatoes, turnips, and onions in a thick gravy--that I have to
force myself to slow down. All around the dining hall, you
can feel the rejuvenating effect that a good meal can bring
on. The way it can make people kinder, funnier, more
optimistic, and remind them it's not a mistake to go on
living. It's better than any medicine. So I try to make it last
and join in the conversation. Sop up the gravy on my bread
and nibble on it as I listen to Finnick telling some ridiculous
story about a sea turtle swimming off with his hat. Laugh
before I realize he's standing there. Directly across the
table, behind the empty seat next to Johanna. Watching
me. I choke momentarily as the gravy bread sticks in my
throat.
"Peeta!" says Delly. "It's so nice to see you out...and
about."
Two large guards stand behind him. He holds his tray
awkwardly, balanced on his fingertips since his wrists are
shackled with a short chain between them.
"What's with the fancy bracelets?" asks Johanna.
"I'm not quite trustworthy yet," says Peeta. "I can't even
sit here without your permission." He indicates the guards
with his head.
"Sure he can sit here. We're old friends," says
Johanna, patting the space beside her. The guards nod
and Peeta takes a seat. "Peeta and I had adjoining cells in
the Capitol. We're very familiar with each other's screams."
Annie, who's on Johanna's other side, does that thing
where she covers her ears and exits reality. Finnick shoots
Johanna an angry look as his arm encircles Annie.
"What? My head doctor says I'm not supposed to
censor my thoughts. It's part of my therapy," replies
Johanna.
The life has gone out of our little party. Finnick
murmurs things to Annie until she slowly removes her
hands. Then there's a long silence while people pretend to
eat.
"Annie," says Delly brightly, "did you know it was
Peeta who decorated your wedding cake? Back home, his
family ran the bakery and he did all the icing."
Annie cautiously looks across Johanna. "Thank you,
Peeta. It was beautiful."
"My pleasure, Annie," says Peeta, and I hear that old
note of gentleness in his voice that I thought was gone
forever. Not that it's directed at me. But still.
"If we're going to fit in that walk, we better go," Finnick
tells her. He arranges both of their trays so he can carry
them in one hand while holding tightly to her with the other.
"Good seeing you, Peeta."
"You be nice to her, Finnick. Or I might try and take her
away from you." It could be a joke, if the tone wasn't so
cold. Everything it conveys is wrong. The open distrust of
Finnick, the implication that Peeta has his eye on Annie,
that Annie could desert Finnick, that I do not even exist.
"Oh, Peeta," says Finnick lightly. "Don't make me sorry
I restarted your heart." He leads Annie away after giving me
a concerned glance.
When they're gone, Delly says in a reproachful voice,
"He did save your life, Peeta. More than once."
"For her." He gives me a brief nod. "For the rebellion.
Not for me. I don't owe him anything."
I shouldn't rise to the bait, but I do. "Maybe not. But
Mags is dead and you're still here. That should count for
something."
"Yeah, a lot of things should count for something that
don't seem to, Katniss. I've got some memories I can't
make sense of, and I don't think the Capitol touched them.
A lot of nights on the train, for instance," he says.
Again the implications. That more happened on the
train than did. That what did happen--those nights I only
kept my sanity because his arms were around me--no
longer matters. Everything a lie, everything a way of
misusing him.
Peeta makes a little gesture with his spoon,
connecting Gale and me. "So, are you two officially a
couple now, or are they still dragging out the star-crossed
lover thing?"
"Still dragging," says Johanna.
Spasms cause Peeta's hands to tighten into fists, then
splay out in a bizarre fashion. Is it all he can do to keep
them from my neck? I can feel the tension in Gale's muscles
next to me, fear an altercation. But Gale simply says, "I
wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it myself."
"What's that?" asks Peeta.
"You," Gale answers.
"You'll have to be a little more specific," says Peeta.
"What about me?"
"That they've replaced you with the evil-mutt version of
yourself," says Johanna.
Gale finishes his milk. "You done?" he asks me. I rise
and we cross to drop off our trays. At the door, an old man
stops me because I'm still clutching the rest of my gravy
bread in my hand. Something in my expression, or maybe
the fact that I've made no attempt to conceal it, makes him
go easy on me. He lets me stuff the bread in my mouth and
move on. Gale and I are almost to my compartment when
he speaks again. "I didn't expect that."
"I told you he hated me," I say.
"It's the way he hates you. It's so...familiar. I used to feel
like that," he admits. "When I'd watch you kissing him on the
screen. Only I knew I wasn't being entirely fair. He can't see
that."
We reach my door. "Maybe he just sees me as I really
am. I have to get some sleep."
Gale catches my arm before I can disappear. "So
that's what you're thinking now?" I shrug. "Katniss, as your
oldest friend, believe me when I say he's not seeing you as
you really are." He kisses my cheek and goes.
I sit on my bed, trying to stuff information from my
Military Tactics books into my head while memories of my
nights with Peeta on the train distract me. After about
twenty minutes, Johanna comes in and throws herself
across the foot of my bed. "You missed the best part. Delly
lost her temper at Peeta over how he treated you. She got
very squeaky. It was like someone stabbing a mouse with a
fork repeatedly. The whole dining hall was riveted."
"What'd Peeta do?" I ask.
"He started arguing with himself like he was two
people. The guards had to take him away. On the good
side, no one seemed to notice I finished his stew." Johanna
rubs her hand over her protruding belly. I look at the layer of
grime under her fingernails. Wonder if the people in 7 ever
bathe. We spend a couple of hours quizzing each other on
military terms. I visit my mother and Prim for a while. When
I'm back in my compartment, showered, staring into the
darkness, I finally ask, "Johanna, could you really hear him
screaming?"
"That was part of it," she says. "Like the jabberjays in
the arena. Only it was real. And it didn't stop after an hour.
Tick, tock."
"Tick, tock," I whisper back.
Roses. Wolf mutts. Tributes. Frosted dolphins.
Friends. Mockingjays. Stylists. Me.
Everything screams in my dreams tonight.
18
I throw myself into training with a vengeance. Eat, live,
and breathe the workouts, drills, weapons practice, lectures
on tactics. A handful of us are moved into an additional
class that gives me hope I may be a contender for the
actual war. The soldiers simply call it the Block, but the
tattoo on my arm lists it as S.S.C., short for Simulated
Street Combat. Deep in 13, they've built an artificial Capitol
city block. The instructor breaks us into squads of eight and
we attempt to carry out missions--gaining a position,
destroying a target, searching a home--as if we were really
fighting our way through the Capitol. The thing's rigged so
that everything that can go wrong for you does. A false step
triggers a land mine, a sniper appears on a rooftop, your
gun jams, a crying child leads you into an ambush, your
squadron leader--who's just a voice on the program--gets
hit by a mortar and you have to figure out what to do without
orders. Part of you knows it's fake and that they're not going
to kill you. If you set off a land mine, you hear the explosion
and have to pretend to fall over dead. But in other ways, it
feels pretty real in there--the enemy soldiers dressed in
Peacekeepers' uniforms, the confusion of a smoke bomb.
They even gas us. Johanna and I are the only ones who get
our masks on in time. The rest of our squad gets knocked
out for ten minutes. And the supposedly harmless gas I took
a few lungfuls of gives me a wicked headache for the rest
of the day.
Cressida and her crew tape Johanna and me on the
firing range. I know Gale and Finnick are being filmed as
well. It's part of a new propos series to show the rebels
preparing for the Capitol invasion. On the whole, things are
going pretty well.
Then Peeta starts showing up for our morning
workouts. The manacles are off, but he's still constantly
accompanied by a pair of guards. After lunch, I see him
across the field, drilling with a group of beginners. I don't
know what they're thinking. If a spat with Delly can reduce
him to arguing with himself, he's got no business learning
how to assemble a gun.
When I confront Plutarch, he assures me that it's all for
the camera. They've got footage of Annie getting married
and Johanna hitting targets, but all of Panem is wondering
about Peeta. They need to see he's fighting for the rebels,
not for Snow. And maybe if they could just get a couple of
shots of the two of us, not kissing necessarily, just looking
happy to be back together--
I walk away from the conversation right then. That is not
going to happen.
In my rare moments of downtime, I anxiously watch the
preparations for the invasions. See equipment and
provisions readied, divisions assembled. You can tell when
someone's received orders because they're given a very
short haircut, the mark of a person going into battle. There
is much talk of the opening offensive, which will be to
secure the train tunnels that feed up into the Capitol.
Just a few days before the first troops are to move out,
York unexpectedly tells Johanna and me she's
recommended us for the exam, and we're to report
immediately. There are four parts: an obstacle course that
assesses your physical condition, a written tactics exam, a
test of weapons proficiency, and a simulated combat
situation in the Block. I don't even have time to get nervous
for the first three and do well, but there's a backlog at the
Block. Some kind of technical bug they're working out. A
group of us exchanges information. This much seems true.
You go through alone. There's no predicting what situation
you'll be thrown into. One boy says, under his breath, that
he's heard it's designed to target each individual's
weaknesses.
My weaknesses? That's a door I don't even want to
open. But I find a quiet spot and try to assess what they
might be. The length of the list depresses me. Lack of
physical brute force. A bare minimum of training. And
somehow my stand-out status as the Mockingjay doesn't
seem to be an advantage in a situation where they're trying
to get us to blend into a pack. They could nail me to the wall
on any number of things.
Johanna's called three ahead of me, and I give her a
nod of encouragement. I wish I had been at the top of the
list because now I'm really overthinking the whole thing. By
the time my name's called, I don't know what my strategy
should be. Fortunately, once I'm in the Block, a certain
amount of training does kick in. It's an ambush situation.
Peacekeepers appear almost instantly and I have to make
my way to a rendezvous point to meet up with my scattered
squad. I slowly navigate the street, taking out
Peacekeepers as I go. Two on the rooftop to my left,
another in the doorway up ahead. It's challenging, but not as
hard as I was expecting. There's a nagging feeling that if it's
too simple, I must be missing the point. I'm within a couple
of buildings from my goal when things begin to heat up. A
half dozen Peacekeepers come charging around the
corner. They will outgun me, but I notice something. A drum
of gasoline lying carelessly in the gutter. This is it. My test.
To perceive that blowing up the drum will be the only way to
achieve my mission. Just as I step out to do it, my squadron
leader, who's been fairly useless up to this point, quietly
orders me to hit the ground. Every instinct I have screams
for me to ignore the voice, to pull the trigger, to blow the
Peacekeepers sky-high. And suddenly, I realize what the
military will think my biggest weakness is. From my first
moment in the Games, when I ran for that orange
backpack, to the firefight in 8, to my impulsive race across
the square in 2. I cannot take orders.
I smack into the ground so hard and fast, I'll be picking
gravel out of my chin for a week. Someone else blows the
gas tank. The Peacekeepers die. I make my rendezvous
point. When I exit the Block on the far side, a soldier
congratulates me, stamps my hand with squad number
451, and tells me to report to Command. Almost giddy with
success, I run through the halls, skidding around corners,
bounding down the steps because the elevator's too slow. I
bang into the room before the oddity of the situation dawns
on me. I shouldn't be in Command; I should be getting my
hair buzzed. The people around the table aren't freshly
minted soldiers but the ones calling the shots.
Boggs smiles and shakes his head when he sees me.
"Let's see it." Unsure now, I hold out my stamped hand.
"You're with me. It's a special unit of sharpshooters. Join
your squad." He nods over at a group lining the wall. Gale.
Finnick. Five others I don't know. My squad. I'm not only in, I
get to work under Boggs. With my friends. I force myself to
take calm, soldierly steps to join them, instead of jumping
up and down.
We must be important, too, because we're in
Command, and it has nothing to do with a certain
Mockingjay. Plutarch stands over a wide, flat panel in the
center of the table. He's explaining something about the
nature of what we will encounter in the Capitol. I'm thinking
this is a terrible presentation--because even on tiptoe I
can't see what's on the panel--until he hits a button. A
holographic image of a block of the Capitol projects into
the air.
"This, for example, is the area surrounding one of the
Peacekeepers' barracks. Not unimportant, but not the most
crucial of targets, and yet look." Plutarch enters some sort
of code on a keyboard, and lights begin to flash. They're in
an assortment of colors and blink at different speeds.
"Each light is called a pod. It represents a different
obstacle, the nature of which could be anything from a
bomb to a band of mutts. Make no mistake, whatever it
contains is designed to either trap or kill you. Some have
been in place since the Dark Days, others developed over
the years. To be honest, I created a fair number myself.
This program, which one of our people absconded with
when we left the Capitol, is our most recent information.
They don't know we have it. But even so, it's likely that new
pods have been activated in the last few months. This is
what you will face."
I'm unaware that my feet are moving to the table until
I'm inches from the holograph. My hand reaches in and
cups a rapidly blinking green light.
Someone joins me, his body tense. Finnick, of course.
Because only a victor would see what I see so immediately.
The arena. Laced with pods controlled by Gamemakers.
Finnick's fingers caress a steady red glow over a doorway.
"Ladies and gentlemen..."
His voice is quiet, but mine rings through the room.
"Let the Seventy-sixth Hunger Games begin!"
I laugh. Quickly. Before anyone has time to register
what lies beneath the words I have just uttered. Before
eyebrows are raised, objections are uttered, two and two
are put together, and the solution is that I should be kept as
far away from the Capitol as possible. Because an angry,
independently thinking victor with a layer of psychological
scar tissue too thick to penetrate is maybe the last person
you want on your squad.
"I don't even know why you bothered to put Finnick and
me through training, Plutarch," I say.
"Yeah, we're already the two best-equipped soldiers
you have," Finnick adds cockily.
"Do not think that fact escapes me," he says with an
impatient wave. "Now back in line, Soldiers Odair and
Everdeen. I have a presentation to finish."
We retreat to our places, ignoring the questioning
looks thrown our way. I adopt an attitude of extreme
concentration as Plutarch continues, nodding my head here
and there, shifting my position to get a better view, all the
while telling myself to hang on until I can get to the woods
and scream. Or curse. Or cry. Or maybe all three at once.
If this was a test, Finnick and I both pass it. When
Plutarch finishes and the meeting's adjourned, I have a bad
moment when I learn there's a special order for me. But it's
merely that I skip the military haircut because they would
like the Mockingjay to look as much like the girl in the arena
as possible at the anticipated surrender. For the cameras,
you know. I shrug to communicate that my hair length's a
matter of complete indifference to me. They dismiss me
without further comment.
Finnick and I gravitate toward each other in the
hallway. "What will I tell Annie?" he says under his breath.
"Nothing," I answer. "That's what my mother and sister
will be hearing from me." Bad enough that we know we're
heading back into a fully equipped arena. No use dropping
it on our loved ones.
"If she sees that holograph--" he begins.
"She won't. It's classified information. It must be," I say.
"Anyway, it's not like an actual Games. Any number of
people will survive. We're just overreacting because--well,
you know why. You still want to go, don't you?"
"Of course. I want to destroy Snow as much as you
do," he says.
"It won't be like the others," I say firmly, trying to
convince myself as well. Then the real beauty of the
situation dawns on me. "This time Snow will be a player,
too."
Before we can continue, Haymitch appears. He wasn't
at the meeting, isn't thinking of arenas but something else.
"Johanna's back in the hospital."
I assumed Johanna was fine, had passed her exam,
but simply wasn't assigned to a sharpshooters' unit. She's
wicked throwing an ax but about average with a gun. "Is she
hurt? What happened?"
"It was while she was on the Block. They try to ferret
out a soldier's potential weaknesses. So they flooded the
street," says Haymitch.
This doesn't help. Johanna can swim. At least, I seem
to remember her swimming around some in the Quarter
Quell. Not like Finnick, of course, but none of us are like
Finnick. "So?"
"That's how they tortured her in the Capitol. Soaked
her and then used electric shocks," says Haymitch. "In the
Block she had some kind of flashback. Panicked, didn't
know where she was. She's back under sedation." Finnick
and I just stand there, as if we've lost the ability to respond. I
think of the way Johanna never showers. How she forced
herself into the rain like it was acid that day. I had attributed
her misery to the morphling withdrawal.
"You two should go see her. You're as close to friends
as she's got," says Haymitch.
That makes the whole thing worse. I don't really know
what's between Johanna and Finnick. But I hardly know her.
No family. No friends. Not so much as a token from 7 to set
beside her regulation clothes in her anonymous drawer.
Nothing.
"I better go tell Plutarch. He won't be happy," Haymitch
continues. "He wants as many victors as possible for the
cameras to follow in the Capitol. Thinks it makes for better
television."
"Are you and Beetee going?" I ask.
"As many young and attractive victors as possible,"
Haymitch corrects himself. "So, no. We'll be here."
Finnick goes directly down to see Johanna, but I linger
outside a few minutes until Boggs comes out. He's my
commander now, so I guess he's the one to ask for any
special favors. When I tell him what I want to do, he writes
me a pass so that I can go to the woods during Reflection,
provided I stay within sight of the guards. I run to my
compartment, thinking to use the parachute, but it's so full of
ugly memories. Instead, I go across the hall and take one of
the white cotton bandages I brought from 12. Square.
Sturdy. Just the thing.
In the woods, I find a pine tree and strip handfuls of
fragrant needles from the boughs. After making a neat pile
in the middle of the bandage, I gather up the sides, give
them a twist, and tie them tightly with a length of vine,
making an apple-sized bundle.
At the hospital room door, I watch Johanna for a
moment, realize that most of her ferocity is in her abrasive
attitude. Stripped of that, as she is now, there's only a slight
young woman, her wide-set eyes fighting to stay awake
against the power of the drugs. Terrified of what sleep will
bring. I cross to her and hold out the bundle.
"What's that?" she says hoarsely. Damp edges of her
hair form little spikes over her forehead.
"I made it for you. Something to put in your drawer." I
place it in her hands. "Smell it."
She lifts the bundle to her nose and takes a tentative
sniff. "Smells like home." Tears flood her eyes.
"That's what I was hoping. You being from Seven and
all," I say. "Remember when we met? You were a tree.
Well, briefly."
Suddenly, she has my wrist in an iron grip. "You have
to kill him, Katniss."
"Don't worry." I resist the temptation to wrench my arm
free.
"Swear it. On something you care about," she hisses.
"I swear it. On my life." But she doesn't let go of my
arm.
"On your family's life," she insists.
"On my family's life," I repeat. I guess my concern for
my own survival isn't compelling enough. She lets go and I
rub my wrist. "Why do you think I'm going, anyway,
brainless?"
That makes her smile a little. "I just needed to hear it."
She presses the bundle of pine needles to her nose and
closes her eyes.
The remaining days go by in a whirl. After a brief
workout each morning, my squad's on the shooting range
full-time in training. I practice mostly with a gun, but they
reserve an hour a day for specialty weapons, which means I
get to use my Mockingjay bow, Gale his heavy militarized
one. The trident Beetee designed for Finnick has a lot of
special features, but the most remarkable is that he can
throw it, press a button on a metal cuff on his wrist, and
return it to his hand without chasing it down.
Sometimes we shoot at Peacekeeper dummies to
become familiar with the weaknesses in their protective
gear. The chinks in the armor, so to speak. If you hit flesh,
you're rewarded with a burst of fake blood. Our dummies
are soaked in red.
It's reassuring to see just how high the overall level of
accuracy is in our group. Along with Finnick and Gale, the
squad includes five soldiers from 13. Jackson, a middleaged
woman who's Boggs's second in command, looks
kind of sluggish but can hit things the rest of us can't even
see without a scope. Farsighted, she says. There's a pair
of sisters in their twenties named Leeg--we call them Leeg
1 and Leeg 2 for clarity--who are so similar in uniform, I
can't tell them apart until I notice Leeg 1 has weird yellow
flecks in her eyes. Two older guys, Mitchell and Homes,
never say much but can shoot the dust off your boots at fifty
yards. I see other squads that are also quite good, but I
don't fully understand our status until the morning Plutarch
joins us.
"Squad Four-Five-One, you have been selected for a
special mission," he begins. I bite the inside of my lip,
hoping against hope that it's to assassinate Snow. "We
have numerous sharpshooters, but rather a dearth of
camera crews. Therefore, we've handpicked the eight of
you to be what we call our 'Star Squad.' You will be the onscreen
faces of the invasion."
Disappointment, shock, then anger run through the
group. "What you're saying is, we won't be in actual
combat," snaps Gale.
"You will be in combat, but perhaps not always on the
front line. If one can even isolate a front line in this type of
war," says Plutarch.
"None of us wants that." Finnick's remark is followed
by a general rumble of assent, but I stay silent. "We're
going to fight."
"You're going to be as useful to the war effort as
possible," Plutarch says. "And it's been decided that you
are of most value on television. Just look at the effect
Katniss had running around in that Mockingjay suit. Turned
the whole rebellion around. Do you notice how she's the
only one not complaining? It's because she understands the
power of that screen."
Actually, Katniss isn't complaining because she has no
intention of staying with the "Star Squad," but she
recognizes the necessity of getting to the Capitol before
carrying out any plan. Still, to be too compliant may arouse
suspicion as well.
"But it's not all pretend, is it?" I ask. "That'd be a waste
of talent."
"Don't worry," Plutarch tells me. "You'll have plenty of
real targets to hit. But don't get blown up. I've got enough on
my plate without having to replace you. Now get to the
Capitol and put on a good show."
The morning we ship out, I say good-bye to my family. I
haven't told them how much the Capitol's defenses mirror
the weapons in the arena, but my going off to war is awful
enough on its own. My mother holds me tightly for a long
time. I feel tears on her cheek, something she suppressed
when I was slated for the Games. "Don't worry. I'll be
perfectly safe. I'm not even a real soldier. Just one of
Plutarch's televised puppets," I reassure her.
Prim walks me as far as the hospital doors. "How do
you feel?"
"Better, knowing you're somewhere Snow can't reach
you," I say.
"Next time we see each other, we'll be free of him,"
says Prim firmly. Then she throws her arms around my
neck. "Be careful."
I consider saying a final good-bye to Peeta, decide it
would only be bad for both of us. But I do slip the pearl into
the pocket of my uniform. A token of the boy with the bread.
A hovercraft takes us to, of all places, 12, where a
makeshift transportation area has been set up outside the
fire zone. No luxury trains this time, but a cargo car packed
to the limit with soldiers in their dark gray uniforms,
sleeping with their heads on their packs. After a couple of
days' travel, we disembark inside one of the mountain
tunnels leading to the Capitol, and make the rest of the sixhour
trek on foot, taking care to step only on a glowing
green paint line that marks safe passage to the air above.
We come out in the rebel encampment, a ten-block
stretch outside the train station where Peeta and I made
our previous arrivals. It's already crawling with soldiers.
Squad 451 is assigned a spot to pitch its tents. This area
has been secured for over a week. Rebels pushed out the
Peacekeepers, losing hundreds of lives in the process. The
Capitol forces fell back and have regrouped farther into the
city. Between us lie the booby-trapped streets, empty and
inviting. Each one will need to be swept of pods before we
can advance.
Mitchell asks about hoverplane bombings--we do feel
very naked pitched out in the open--but Boggs says it's not
an issue. Most of the Capitol's air fleet was destroyed in 2
or during the invasion. If it has any craft left, it's holding on to
them. Probably so Snow and his inner circle can make a
last-minute escape to some presidential bunker
somewhere if needed. Our own hoverplanes were
grounded after the Capitol's antiaircraft missiles decimated
the first few waves. This war will be battled out on the
streets with, hopefully, only superficial damage to the
infrastructure and a minimum of human casualties. The
rebels want the Capitol, just as the Capitol wanted 13.
After three days, much of Squad 451 risks deserting
out of boredom. Cressida and her team take shots of us
firing. They tell us we're part of the disinformation team. If
the rebels only shoot Plutarch's pods, it will take the Capitol
about two minutes to realize we have the holograph. So
there's a lot of time spent shattering things that don't matter,
to throw them off the scent. Mostly we just add to the piles
of rainbow glass that's been blown off the exteriors of the
candy-colored buildings. I suspect they are intercutting this
footage with the destruction of significant Capitol targets.
Once in a while it seems a real sharpshooter's services are
needed. Eight hands go up, but Gale, Finnick, and I are
never chosen.
"It's your own fault for being so camera-ready," I tell
Gale. If looks could kill.
I don't think they quite know what to do with the three of
us, particularly me. I have my Mockingjay outfit with me, but
I've only been taped in my uniform. Sometimes I use a gun,
sometimes they ask me to shoot with my bow and arrows.
It's as if they don't want to entirely lose the Mockingjay, but
they want to downgrade my role to foot soldier. Since I don't
care, it's amusing rather than upsetting to imagine the
arguments going on back in 13.
While I outwardly express discontent about our lack of
any real participation, I'm busy with my own agenda. Each
of us has a paper map of the Capitol. The city forms an
almost perfect square. Lines divide the map into smaller
squares, with letters along the top and numbers down the
side to form a grid. I consume this, noting every intersection
and side street, but it's remedial stuff. The commanders
here are working off Plutarch's holograph. Each has a
handheld contraption called a Holo that produces images
like I saw in Command. They can zoom into any area of the
grid and see what pods await them. The Holo's an
independent unit, a glorified map really, since it can neither
send nor receive signals. But it's far superior to my paper
version.
A Holo is activated by a specific commander's voice
giving his or her name. Once it's working, it responds to the
other voices in the squadron so if, say, Boggs were killed
or severely disabled, someone could take over. If anyone in
the squad repeats "nightlock" three times in a row, the Holo
will explode, blowing everything in a five-yard radius skyhigh.
This is for security reasons in the event of capture. It's
understood that we would all do this without hesitation.
So what I need to do is steal Boggs's activated Holo
and clear out before he notices. I think it would be easier to
steal his teeth.
On the fourth morning, Soldier Leeg 2 hits a
mislabeled pod. It doesn't unleash a swarm of muttation
gnats, which the rebels are prepared for, but shoots out a
sunburst of metal darts. One finds her brain. She's gone
before the medics can reach her. Plutarch promises a
speedy replacement.
The following evening, the newest member of our
squad arrives. With no manacles. No guards. Strolling out
of the train station with his gun swinging from the strap over
his shoulder. There's shock, confusion, resistance, but 451
is stamped on the back of Peeta's hand in fresh ink. Boggs
relieves him of his weapon and goes to make a call.
"It won't matter," Peeta tells the rest of us. "The
president assigned me herself. She decided the propos
needed some heating up."
Maybe they do. But if Coin sent Peeta here, she's
decided something else as well. That I'm of more use to her
dead than alive.
PART III
"THE ASSASSIN"
19
I've never really seen Boggs angry before. Not when
I've disobeyed his orders or puked on him, not even when
Gale broke his nose. But he's angry when he returns from
his phone call with the president. The first thing he does is
instruct Soldier Jackson, his second in command, to set up
a two-person, round-the-clock guard on Peeta. Then he
takes me on a walk, weaving through the sprawling tent
encampment until our squad is far behind us.
"He'll try and kill me anyway," I say. "Especially here.
Where there are so many bad memories to set him off."
"I'll keep him contained, Katniss," says Boggs.
"Why does Coin want me dead now?" I ask.
"She denies she does," he answers.
"But we know it's true," I say. "And you must at least
have a theory."
Boggs gives me a long, hard look before he answers.
"Here's as much as I know. The president doesn't like you.
She never did. It was Peeta she wanted rescued from the
arena, but no one else agreed. It made matters worse when
you forced her to give the other victors immunity. But even
that could be overlooked in view of how well you've
performed."
"Then what is it?" I insist.
"Sometime in the near future, this war will be resolved.
A new leader will be chosen," says Boggs.
I roll my eyes. "Boggs, no one thinks I'm going to be
the leader."
"No. They don't," he agrees. "But you'll throw support to
someone. Would it be President Coin? Or someone else?"
"I don't know. I've never thought about it," I say.
"If your immediate answer isn't Coin, then you're a
threat. You're the face of the rebellion. You may have more
influence than any other single person," says Boggs.
"Outwardly, the most you've ever done is tolerated her."
"So she'll kill me to shut me up." The minute I say the
words, I know they're true.
"She doesn't need you as a rallying point now. As she
said, your primary objective, to unite the districts, has
succeeded," Boggs reminds me. "These current propos
could be done without you. There's only one last thing you
could do to add fire to the rebellion."
"Die," I say quietly.
"Yes. Give us a martyr to fight for," says Boggs. "But
that's not going to happen under my watch, Soldier
Everdeen. I'm planning for you to have a long life."
"Why?" This kind of thinking will only bring him trouble.
"You don't owe me anything."
"Because you've earned it," he says. "Now get back to
your squad."
I know I should feel appreciative of Boggs sticking his
neck out for me, but really I'm just frustrated. I mean, how
can I steal his Holo and desert now? Betraying him was
complicated enough without this whole new layer of debt. I
already owe him for saving my life.
Seeing the cause of my current dilemma calmly
pitching his tent back at our site makes me furious. "What
time is my watch?" I ask Jackson.
She squints at me in doubt, or maybe she's just trying
to get my face in focus. "I didn't put you in the rotation."
"Why not?" I ask.
"I'm not sure you could really shoot Peeta, if it came to
it," she says.
I speak up so the whole squad can hear me clearly. "I
wouldn't be shooting Peeta. He's gone. Johanna's right. It'd
be just like shooting another of the Capitol's mutts." It feels
good to say something horrible about him, out loud, in
public, after all the humiliation I've felt since his return.
"Well, that sort of comment isn't recommending you
either," says Jackson.
"Put her in the rotation," I hear Boggs say behind me.
Jackson shakes her head and makes a note.
"Midnight to four. You're on with me."
The dinner whistle sounds, and Gale and I line up at
the canteen. "Do you want me to kill him?" he asks bluntly.
"That'll get us both sent back for sure," I say. But even
though I'm furious, the brutality of the offer rattles me. "I can
deal with him."
"You mean until you take off? You and your paper map
and possibly a Holo if you can get your hands on it?" So
Gale has not missed my preparations. I hope they haven't
been so obvious to the others. None of them know my mind
like he does, though. "You're not planning on leaving me
behind, are you?" he asks.
Up until this point, I was. But having my hunting partner
to watch my back doesn't sound like a bad idea. "As your
fellow soldier, I have to strongly recommend you stay with
your squad. But I can't stop you from coming, can I?"
He grins. "No. Not unless you want me to alert the rest
of the army."
Squad 451 and the television crew collect dinner from
the canteen and gather in a tense circle to eat. At first I think
that Peeta is the cause of the unease, but by the end of the
meal, I realize more than a few unfriendly looks have been
directed my way. This is a quick turnaround, since I'm pretty
sure when Peeta appeared the whole team was concerned
about how dangerous he might be, especially to me. But it's
not until I get a phone call through to Haymitch that I
understand.
"What are you trying to do? Provoke him into an
attack?" he asks me.
"Of course not. I just want him to leave me alone," I say.
"Well, he can't. Not after what the Capitol put him
through," says Haymitch. "Look, Coin may have sent him
there hoping he'd kill you, but Peeta doesn't know that. He
doesn't understand what's happened to him. So you can't
blame him--"
"I don't!" I say.
"You do! You're punishing him over and over for things
that are out of his control. Now, I'm not saying you shouldn't
have a fully loaded weapon next to you round the clock. But
I think it's time you flipped this little scenario around in your
head. If you'd been taken by the Capitol, and hijacked, and
then tried to kill Peeta, is this the way he would be treating
you?" demands Haymitch.
I fall silent. It isn't. It isn't how he would be treating me at
all. He would be trying to get me back at any cost. Not
shutting me out, abandoning me, greeting me with hostility
at every turn.
"You and me, we made a deal to try and save him.
Remember?" Haymitch says. When I don't respond, he
disconnects after a curt "Try and remember."
The autumn day turns from brisk to cold. Most of the
squad hunker down in their sleeping bags. Some sleep
under the open sky, close to the heater in the center of our
camp, while others retreat to their tents. Leeg 1 has finally
broken down over her sister's death, and her muffled sobs
reach us through the canvas. I huddle in my tent, thinking
over Haymitch's words. Realizing with shame that my
fixation with assassinating Snow has allowed me to ignore
a much more difficult problem. Trying to rescue Peeta from
the shadowy world the hijacking has stranded him in. I don't
know how to find him, let alone lead him out. I can't even
conceive of a plan. It makes the task of crossing a loaded
arena, locating Snow, and putting a bullet through his head
look like child's play.
At midnight, I crawl out of my tent and position myself
on a camp stool near the heater to take my watch with
Jackson. Boggs told Peeta to sleep out in full view where
the rest of us could keep an eye on him. He isn't sleeping,
though. Instead, he sits with his bag pulled up to his chest,
clumsily trying to make knots in a short length of rope. I
know it well. It's the one Finnick lent me that night in the
bunker. Seeing it in his hands, it's like Finnick's echoing
what Haymitch just said, that I've cast off Peeta. Now might
be a good time to begin to remedy that. If I could think of
something to say. But I can't. So I don't. I just let the sounds
of soldiers' breathing fill the night.
After about an hour, Peeta speaks up. "These last
couple of years must have been exhausting for you. Trying
to decide whether to kill me or not. Back and forth. Back
and forth."
That seems grossly unfair, and my first impulse is to
say something cutting. But I revisit my conversation with
Haymitch and try to take the first tentative step in Peeta's
direction. "I never wanted to kill you. Except when I thought
you were helping the Careers kill me. After that, I always
thought of you as...an ally." That's a good safe word. Empty
of any emotional obligation, but nonthreatening.
"Ally." Peeta says the word slowly, tasting it. "Friend.
Lover. Victor. Enemy. Fiancee. Target. Mutt. Neighbor.
Hunter. Tribute. Ally. I'll add it to the list of words I use to try
to figure you out." He weaves the rope in and out of his
fingers. "The problem is, I can't tell what's real anymore,
and what's made up."
The cessation of rhythmic breathing suggests that
either people have woken or have never really been asleep
at all. I suspect the latter.
Finnick's voice rises from a bundle in the shadows.
"Then you should ask, Peeta. That's what Annie does."
"Ask who?" Peeta says. "Who can I trust?"
"Well, us for starters. We're your squad," says
Jackson.
"You're my guards," he points out.
"That, too," she says. "But you saved a lot of lives in
Thirteen. It's not the kind of thing we forget."
In the quiet that follows, I try to imagine not being able
to tell illusion from reality. Not knowing if Prim or my mother
loved me. If Snow was my enemy. If the person across the
heater saved or sacrificed me. With very little effort, my life
rapidly morphs into a nightmare. I suddenly want to tell
Peeta everything about who he is, and who I am, and how
we ended up here. But I don't know how to start. Worthless.
I'm worthless.
At a few minutes before four, Peeta turns to me again.
"Your favorite color...it's green?"
"That's right." Then I think of something to add. "And
yours is orange."
"Orange?" He seems unconvinced.
"Not bright orange. But soft. Like the sunset," I say. "At
least, that's what you told me once."
"Oh." He closes his eyes briefly, maybe trying to
conjure up that sunset, then nods his head. "Thank you."
But more words tumble out. "You're a painter. You're a
baker. You like to sleep with the windows open. You never
take sugar in your tea. And you always double-knot your
shoelaces."
Then I dive into my tent before I do something stupid
like cry.
In the morning, Gale, Finnick, and I go out to shoot
some glass off the buildings for the camera crew. When we
get back to camp, Peeta's sitting in a circle with the
soldiers from 13, who are armed but talking openly with
him. Jackson has devised a game called "Real or Not
Real" to help Peeta. He mentions something he thinks
happened, and they tell him if it's true or imagined, usually
followed by a brief explanation.
"Most of the people from Twelve were killed in the fire."
"Real. Less than nine hundred of you made it to
Thirteen alive."
"The fire was my fault."
"Not real. President Snow destroyed Twelve the way
he did Thirteen, to send a message to the rebels."
This seems like a good idea until I realize that I'll be the
only one who can confirm or deny most of what weighs on
him. Jackson breaks us up into watches. She matches up
Finnick, Gale, and me each with a soldier from 13. This
way Peeta will always have access to someone who knows
him more personally. It's not a steady conversation. Peeta
spends a long time considering even small pieces of
information, like where people bought their soap back
home. Gale fills him in on a lot of stuff about 12; Finnick is
the expert on both of Peeta's Games, as he was a mentor
in the first and a tribute in the second. But since Peeta's
greatest confusion centers around me--and not everything
can be explained simply--our exchanges are painful and
loaded, even though we touch on only the most superficial
of details. The color of my dress in 7. My preference for
cheese buns. The name of our math teacher when we were
little. Reconstructing his memory of me is excruciating.
Perhaps it isn't even possible after what Snow did to him.
But it does feel right to help him try.
The next afternoon, we're notified that the whole squad
is needed to stage a fairly complicated propo. Peeta's
been right about one thing: Coin and Plutarch are unhappy
with the quality of footage they're getting from the Star
Squad. Very dull. Very uninspiring. The obvious response
is that they never let us do anything but playact with our
guns. However, this is not about defending ourselves, it's
about coming up with a usable product. So today, a special
block has been set aside for filming. It even has a couple of
active pods on it. One unleashes a spray of gunfire. The
other nets the invader and traps them for either
interrogation or execution, depending on the captors'
preference. But it's still an unimportant residential block
with nothing of strategic consequence.
The television crew means to provide a sense of
heightened jeopardy by releasing smoke bombs and
adding gunfire sound effects. We suit up in heavy protective
gear, even the crew, as if we're heading into the heart of
battle. Those of us with specialty weapons are allowed to
take them along with our guns. Boggs gives Peeta back his
gun, too, although he makes sure to tell him in a loud voice
that it's only loaded with blanks.
Peeta just shrugs. "I'm not much of a shot anyway." He
seems preoccupied with watching Pollux, to the point
where it's getting a little worrisome, when he finally puzzles
it out and begins to speak with agitation. "You're an Avox,
aren't you? I can tell by the way you swallow. There were
two Avoxes with me in prison. Darius and Lavinia, but the
guards mostly called them the redheads. They'd been our
servants in the Training Center, so they arrested them, too. I
watched them being tortured to death. She was lucky. They
used too much voltage and her heart stopped right off. It
took days to finish him off. Beating, cutting off parts. They
kept asking him questions, but he couldn't speak, he just
made these horrible animal sounds. They didn't want
information, you know? They wanted me to see it."
Peeta looks around at our stunned faces, as if waiting
for a reply. When none is forthcoming, he asks, "Real or not
real?" The lack of response upsets him more. "Real or not
real?!" he demands.
"Real," says Boggs. "At least, to the best of my
knowledge...real."
Peeta sags. "I thought so. There was nothing...shiny
about it." He wanders away from the group, muttering
something about fingers and toes.
I move to Gale, press my forehead into the body armor
where his chest should be, feel his arm tighten around me.
We finally know the name of the girl who we watched the
Capitol abduct from the woods of 12, the fate of the
Peacekeeper friend who tried to keep Gale alive. This is no
time to call up happy moments of remembrance. They lost
their lives because of me. I add them to my personal list of
kills that began in the arena and now includes thousands.
When I look up, I see it has taken Gale differently. His
expression says that there are not enough mountains to
crush, enough cities to destroy. It promises death.
With Peeta's grisly account fresh in our minds, we
crunch through the streets of broken glass until we reach
our target, the block we are to take. It is a real, if small, goal
to accomplish. We gather around Boggs to examine the
Holo projection of the street. The gunfire pod is positioned
about a third of the way down, just above an apartment
awning. We should be able to trigger it with bullets. The net
pod is at the far end, almost the next corner. This will
require someone to set off the body sensor mechanism.
Everyone volunteers except Peeta, who doesn't seem to
know quite what's going on. I don't get picked. I get sent to
Messalla, who dabs some makeup on my face for the
anticipated close-ups.
The squad positions itself under Boggs's direction,
and then we have to wait for Cressida to get the
cameramen in place as well. They're both to our left, with
Castor toward the front and Pollux bringing up the rear so
they'll be sure not to record each other. Messalla sets off a
couple of smoke charges for atmosphere. Since this is
both a mission and a shoot, I'm about to ask who's in
charge, my commander or my director, when Cressida
calls, "Action!"
We slowly proceed down the hazy street, just like one
of our exercises in the Block. Everyone has at least one
section of windows to blow out, but Gale's assigned the
real target. When he hits the pod, we take cover--ducking
into doorways or flattening onto the pretty, light orange and
pink paving stones--as a hail of bullets sweeps back and
forth over our heads. After a while, Boggs orders us
forward.
Cressida stops us before we can rise, since she
needs some close-up shots. We take turns reenacting our
responses. Falling to the ground, grimacing, diving into
alcoves. We know it's supposed to be serious business,
but the whole thing feels a little ridiculous. Especially when
it turns out that I'm not the worst actor in the squad. Not by a
long shot. We're all laughing so hard at Mitchell's attempt to
project his idea of desperation, which involves teeth
grinding and nostrils flaring, that Boggs has to reprimand
us.
"Pull it together, Four-Five-One," he says firmly. But
you can see him suppressing a smile as he's doublechecking
the next pod. Positioning the Holo to find the best
light in the smoky air. Still facing us as his left foot steps
back onto the orange paving stone. Triggering the bomb
that blows off his legs.
20
It's as if in an instant, a painted window shatters,
revealing the ugly world behind it. Laughter changes to
screams, blood stains pastel stones, real smoke darkens
the special effect stuff made for television.
A second explosion seems to split the air and leaves
my ears ringing. But I can't make out where it came from.
I reach Boggs first, try to make sense of the torn flesh,
missing limbs, to find something to stem the red flow from
his body. Homes pushes me aside, wrenching open a firstaid
kit. Boggs clutches my wrist. His face, gray with dying
and ash, seems to be receding. But his next words are an
order. "The Holo."
The Holo. I scramble around, digging through chunks
of tile slick with blood, shuddering when I encounter bits of
warm flesh. Find it rammed into a stairwell with one of
BoggsCatching fire

PART I "THE SPARK"

I clasp the flask between my hands even though the warmth from the tea has long since leached into the frozen air. My muscles are clenched tight against the cold. If a pack of wild dogs were to appear at this moment, the odds of scaling a tree before they attacked are not in my favor. I should get up, move around, and work the stiffness from my limbs. But instead I sit, as motionless as the rock beneath me, while the dawn begins to lighten the woods. I can't fight the sun. I can only watch helplessly as it drags me into a day that I've been dreading for months. By noon they will all be at my new house in the Victor's Village. The reporters, the camera crews, even Effie Trinket, my old escort, will have

made their way to District 12 from the Capitol. I wonder if Effie will still be wearing that silly pink wig, or if she'll be sporting some other unnatural color especially for the Victory Tour. There will be others waiting, too. A staff to cater to my every need on the long train trip. A prep team to beautify me for public appearances. My stylist and friend, Cinna, who designed the gorgeous outfits that first made the audience take notice of me in the Hunger Games. If it were up to me, I would try to forget the Hunger Games entirely. Never speak of them. Pretend they were nothing but a bad dream. But the Victory Tour makes that impossible. Strategically placed almost midway between the annual Games, it is the Capitol's way of keeping the horror fresh and immediate. Not only are we in the districts forced to remember the iron grip of the Capitol's power each year, we are forced to celebrate it. And this year, I am one of the stars
of the show. I will have to travel from district to district, to stand before the cheering crowds who secretly loathe me, to look down into the faces of the families whose children I have killed... The sun persists in rising, so I make myself stand. All my joints complain and my left leg has been asleep for so long that it takes several minutes of pacing to bring the feeling back into it. I've been in the woods three hours, but as I've made no real attempt at hunting, I have nothing to show for it. It doesn't matter for my mother and little sister, Prim, anymore. They can afford to buy butcher meat in town, although none of us likes it any better than fresh game. But my best friend, Gale Hawthorne, and his family will be depending on today's haul and I can't let them down. I start the hour-and-a-half trek it will take to cover our snare line. Back when we were in school, we had time in the afternoons to check the line and hunt and gather and still

get back to trade in town. But now that Gale has gone to work in the coal mines -- and I have nothing to do all day--I've taken over the job. By this time Gale will have clocked in at the

mines, taken the stomach-churning elevator ride into the depths of the earth, and be pounding away at a coal seam. I know what it's like down there. Every year in school, as part of our training, my class had to tour the mines. When I was little, it was just unpleasant. The claustrophobic tunnels, foul air, suffocating darkness on all sides. But after my father and several other miners were killed in an explosion, I could barely force myself onto the elevator. The annual trip became an enormous source of anxiety. Twice I made myself so sick in anticipation of it that my mother kept me home because she thought I had contracted the flu. I
think of Gale, who is only really alive in the woods, with its fresh air and sunlight and clean, flowing water. I don't know how he stands it. Well ... yes, I do. He stands it because it's the way to feed his mother and two younger brothers and sister. And here I am with buckets of money, far more than enough to feed both our families now, and he won't take a single coin. It's even hard for him to let me bring in meat, although he'd surely have kept my mother and Prim supplied if I'd been killed in the Games. I tell him he's doing me a favor, that it drives me nuts to sit around all day. Even so, I never drop off the game while he's at home. Which is easy since he works twelve hours a day. The only time I really get to see Gale now is on Sundays, when we meet up in the woods to hunt together. It's still the best day of the week, but it's not like it used to be before, when we could tell each other anything. The Games have spoiled even that. I keep

hoping that as time passes we'll regain the ease between us, but part of me knows it's futile. There's no going back. I get a good haul from the traps -- eight rabbits, two squirrels, and a beaver that swam into a wire contraption Gale designed himself. He's something of a whiz with snares, rigging them to bent saplings so they pull the kill out of the reach of predators, balancing logs on delicate stick triggers, weaving inescapable baskets to capture fish. As I go along, carefully resetting each snare, I know I can never quite replicate his eye for balance, his instinct for where the prey will cross the path. It's more than experience. It's a natural gift. Like the way I can shoot at an animal in almost complete darkness and still take it down with one arrow. By the time I make it back to the fence that surrounds District 12, the sun is well up. As always, I listen a moment, but there's no telltale hum of electrical current running through the chain
link. There hardly ever is, even though the thing is supposed to be charged full-time. I wriggle through the opening at the bottom of the fence and come up in the Meadow, just a stone's throw from my home. My old home. We still get to keep it since officially it's the designated dwelling of my mother and sister. If I should drop dead right now, they would have to return to it. But at present, they're both

happily installed in the new house in the Victor's Village, and I'm the only one who uses the squat little place where I was raised. To me, it's my real home. I go there now to switch my clothes. Exchange my father's old leather jacket for a fine wool coat that always seems too tight in the shoulders. Leave my soft, worn hunting boots for a pair of expensive machine-made shoes that my mother thinks are more appropriate for someone of my status. I've already

stowed my bow and arrows in a hollow log in the woods. Although time is ticking away, I allow myself a few minutes to sit in the kitchen. It has an abandoned quality with no fire on the hearth, no cloth on the table. I mourn my old life here. We barely scraped by, but I knew where I fit in, I knew what my place was in the tightly interwoven fabric that was our life. I wish I could go back to it because, in retrospect, it seems so secure compared with now, when I am so rich and so famous and so hated by the authorities in the Capitol. A wailing at the back door demands my attention. I open it to find Buttercup, Prim's scruffy old tomcat. He dislikes the new house almost as much as I do and always leaves it when my sister's at school. We've never been particularly fond of each other, but now we have this new bond. I let him in, feed him a chunk of beaver fat, and even rub him between the ears for a bit. "You're hideous, you
know that, right?" I ask him. Buttercup nudges my hand for more petting, but we have to go. "Come on, you." I scoop him up with one hand, grab my game bag with the other, and haul them both out onto the street. The cat springs free and disappears under a bush. The shoes pinch my toes as I crunch along the cinder street. Cutting down alleys and through backyards gets me to Gale's house in minutes. His mother, Hazelle, sees me through the window, where she's bent over the kitchen sink. She dries her hands on her apron and disappears to meet me at the door. I like Hazelle. Respect her. The explosion that killed my father took out her husband as well, leaving her with three boys and a baby due any day. Less than a week after she gave birth, she was out hunting the streets for work. The mines weren't an option, what with a baby to look after, but she managed to get laundry from some of the merchants in town.

At fourteen, Gale, the eldest of the kids, became the main supporter of the family. He was already signed up for tesserae, which entitled them to a meager supply of grain and oil in exchange for his entering his name extra times in the drawing to become a tribute. On top of that, even back then, he was a skilled trapper. But it wasn't enough to keep a family of five without Hazelle working her fingers to the bone on that washboard. In winter her hands got so red and cracked, they bled at the slightest provocation. Still would if it wasn't for a salve my mother concocted. But they are determined, Hazelle and Gale, that the other boys, twelve- year-old Rory and

ten-year-old Vick, and the baby, four-year-old Posy, will never have to sign up for tesserae. Hazelle smiles when she sees the game. She takes the beaver by the tail, feeling its
weight. "He's going to make a nice stew." Unlike Gale, she has no problem with our hunting arrangement. "Good pelt, too," I answer. It's comforting here with Hazelle. Weighing the merits of the game, just as we always have. She pours me a mug of herb tea, which I wrap my chilled fingers around gratefully. "You know, when I get back from the tour, I was thinking I might take Rory out with me sometimes. After school. Teach him to shoot." Hazelle nods. "That'd be good. Gale means to, but he's only got his Sundays, and I think he likes saving those for you." I can't stop the redness that floods my cheeks. It's stupid, of course. Hardly anybody knows me better than Hazelle. Knows the bond I share with Gale. I'm sure plenty of people assumed that we'd eventually get married even if I never gave it any thought. But that was before the Games. Before my fellow tribute, Peeta Mellark, announced he was madly in love with me. Our romance

became a key strategy for our survival in the arena. Only it wasn't just a strategy for Peeta. I'm not sure what it was for me. But I know now it was nothing but painful for Gale. My chest tightens as I think about how, on the Victory Tour, Peeta and I will have to present ourselves as lovers again. I gulp my tea even though it's too hot and push back from the table. "I better get going. Make myself presentable for the cameras." Hazelle hugs me. "Enjoy the food." "Absolutely," I say. My next stop is the Hob, where I've traditionally done the bulk of my trading. Years ago it was a warehouse to store coal, but when it fell into disuse, it became a meeting place for illegal trades and then blossomed into a full-time black market. If it attracts a somewhat criminal element, then I belong here, I guess. Hunting in the woods surrounding District 12 violates at least a dozen laws and is punishable by death. Although they
never mention it, I owe the people who frequent the Hob. Gale told me that Greasy Sae, the old woman who serves up soup, started a collection to sponsor Peeta and me during the Games. It was supposed to be just a Hob thing, but a lot of other people heard about it and chipped in. I don't know exactly how much it was, and the price of any gift in the arena was exorbitant. But for all I know, it made the difference between my life and death. It's still odd to drag open the front door with an empty game bag, with nothing to trade, and instead feel the heavy pocket of coins against my hip. I try to hit as many stalls as possible, spreading out my purchases of coffee, buns, eggs, yarn, and oil. As an afterthought, I buy three bottles of white liquor from a one-armed woman named Ripper, a victim of a mine accident who was smart enough to find a way to stay alive. The liquor isn't for my family. It's for Haymitch,

who acted as mentor for Peeta and me in the Games. He's surly, violent, and drunk most of the time. But he did his job -- more than his job--because for the first time in history, two tributes were allowed to win. So no matter who Haymitch is, I owe him, too. And that's for always. I'm getting the white liquor because a few weeks ago he ran out and there was none for sale and he had a withdrawal, shaking and screaming at terrifying things only he could see. He scared Prim to death and, frankly, it wasn't much fun for me to see him like that, either. Ever since then I've been sort of stockpiling the stuff just in case there's a shortage again. Cray, our Head Peacekeeper, frowns when he sees me with the bottles. He's an older man with a few strands of silver hair combed sideways above his bright red face. "That stuff's too strong for you, girl." He should know. Next to Haymitch, Cray drinks more than anyone I've ever met. "Aw, my
mother uses it in medicines," I say indifferently. "Well, it'd kill just about anything," he says, and slaps down a coin for a bottle. When I reach Greasy Sae's stall, I boost myself up to sit on the counter and order some soup, which looks to be some kind of gourd and bean mixture. A Peacekeeper named Darius comes up and buys a bowl while I'm eating. As law enforcers go, he's one of my favorites. Never really throwing his weight around, usually good for a joke. He's probably in his twenties, but he doesn't seem much older than I do. Something about his smile, his red hair that sticks out every which way, gives him a boyish quality. "Aren't you supposed to be on a train?" he asks me. "They're collecting me at noon," I answer.

"Shouldn't you look better?" he asks in a loud whisper. I can't help smiling at his teasing, in spite of my mood. "Maybe

a ribbon in your hair or something?" He flicks my braid with his hand and I brush him away. "Don't worry. By the time they get through with me I'll be unrecognizable," I say. "Good," he says. "Let's show a little district pride for a change, Miss Everdeen. Hm?" He shakes his head at Greasy Sae in mock disapproval and walks off to join his friends. "I'll want that bowl back," Greasy Sae calls after him, but since she's laughing, she doesn't sound particularly stern. "Gale going to see you off?" she asks me. "No, he wasn't on the list," I say. "I saw him Sunday, though." "Think he'd have made the list. Him being your cousin and all," she says wryly. It's just one more part of the lie the Capitol has concocted. When Peeta and I made it into the final eight in the Hunger Games, they sent reporters to do personal stories about us. When they asked about my friends, everyone directed them to Gale. But it wouldn't do, what with the romance I was playing out in
the arena, to have my best friend be Gale. He was too handsome, too male, and not the least bit willing to smile and play nice for the cameras. We do resemble each other, though, quite a bit. We have that Seam look. Dark straight hair, olive skin, gray eyes. So some genius made him my cousin. I didn't know about it until we were already home, on the platform at the train station, and my mother said, "Your cousins can hardly wait to see you!" Then I turned and saw Gale and Hazelle and all the kids waiting for me, so what could I do but go along? Greasy Sae knows we're not related, but even some of the people who have known us for years seem to have forgotten. "I just can't wait for the whole thing to be over," I whisper. "I know," says Greasy Sae. "But you've got to go through it to get to the end of it. Better not be late." A light snow starts to fall as I make my way to the Victor's Village. It's about a half-mile walk from the square in the

center of town, but it seems like another world entirely. It's a separate community built around a beautiful green, dotted with flowering bushes. There are twelve houses, each large enough to hold ten of the one I was raised in. Nine stand empty, as they always have. The three in use belong to Haymitch, Peeta, and me. The houses inhabited by my family and Peeta give off a warm glow of life. Lit windows, smoke from the chimneys, bunches of brightly colored corn affixed to the front doors as decoration for the upcoming Harvest Festival. However, Haymitch's house, despite the care taken by the grounds-keeper, exudes an air of abandonment and neglect. I brace myself at his front door, knowing it will be foul, then push inside. My nose immediately wrinkles in disgust. Haymitch refuses to let anyone in to clean and does a poor jobekeepers line the
roof across from our former hideout. Shells are launched
into the row of apartments, setting off the chain of
explosions we heard, and the building collapses into rubble
and dust.
Now we cut to a live feed. A reporter stands on the roof
with the Peacekeepers. Behind her, the apartment block
burns. Firefighters try to control the blaze with water hoses.
We are pronounced dead.
"Finally, a bit of luck," says Homes.
I guess he's right. Certainly it's better than having the
Capitol in pursuit of us. But I just keep imagining how this
will be playing back in 13. Where my mother and Prim,
Hazelle and the kids, Annie, Haymitch, and a whole lot of
people from 13 think that they have just seen us die.
"My father. He just lost my sister and now..." says Leeg
1.
We watch as they play the footage over and over.
Revel in their victory, especially over me. Break away to do
a montage of the Mockingjay's rise to rebel power--I think
they've had this part prepared for a while, because it
seems pretty polished--and then go live so a couple of
reporters can discuss my well-deserved violent end. Later,
they promise, Snow will make an official statement. The
screen fades back to a glow.
The rebels made no attempt to break in during the
broadcast, which leads me to believe they think it's true. If
that's so, we really are on our own.
"So, now that we're dead, what's our next move?" asks
Gale."
Isn't it obvious?" No one even knew Peeta had
regained consciousness. I don't know how long he's been
watching, but by the look of misery on his face, long enough
to see what happened on the street. How he went mad,
tried to bash my head in, and hurled Mitchell into the pod.
He painfully pushes himself up to a sitting position and
directs his words to Gale.
"Our next move...is to kill me."
21
That makes two requests for Peeta's death in less than
an hour.
"Don't be ridiculous," says Jackson.
"I just murdered a member of our squad!" shouts
Peeta.
"You pushed him off you. You couldn't have known he
would trigger the net at that exact spot," says Finnick, trying
to calm him.
"Who cares? He's dead, isn't he?" Tears begin to run
down Peeta's face. "I didn't know. I've never seen myself
like that before. Katniss is right. I'm the monster. I'm the
mutt. I'm the one Snow has turned into a weapon!"
"It's not your fault, Peeta," says Finnick.
"You can't take me with you. It's only a matter of time
before I kill someone else." Peeta looks around at our
conflicted faces. "Maybe you think it's kinder to just dump
me somewhere. Let me take my chances. But that's the
same thing as handing me over to the Capitol. Do you think
you'd be doing me a favor by sending me back to Snow?"
Peeta. Back in Snow's hands. Tortured and tormented
until no bits of his former self will ever emerge again.
For some reason, the last stanza to "The Hanging
Tree" starts running through my head. The one where the
man wants his lover dead rather than have her face the evil
that awaits her in the world.
Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Wear a necklace of rope, side by side with
me.
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree.
"I'll kill you before that happens," says Gale. "I
promise."
Peeta hesitates, as if considering the reliability of this
offer, and then shakes his head. "It's no good. What if
you're not there to do it? I want one of those poison pills like
the rest of you have."
Nightlock. There's one pill back at camp, in its special
slot on the sleeve of my Mockingjay suit. But there's another
in the breast pocket of my uniform. Interesting that they
didn't issue one to Peeta. Perhaps Coin thought he might
take it before he had the opportunity to kill me. It's unclear if
Peeta means he'd finish himself off now, to spare us having
to murder him, or only if the Capitol took him prisoner
again. In the state he's in, I expect it would be sooner rather
than later. It would certainly make things easier on the rest
of us. Not to have to shoot him. It would certainly simplify the
problem of dealing with his homicidal episodes.
I don't know if it's the pods, or the fear, or watching
Boggs die, but I feel the arena all around me. It's as if I've
never left, really. Once again I'm battling not only for my own
survival but for Peeta's as well. How satisfying, how
entertaining it would be for Snow to have me kill him. To
have Peeta's death on my conscience for whatever is left of
my life.
"It's not about you," I say. "We're on a mission. And
you're necessary to it." I look to the rest of the group. "Think
we might find some food here?"
Besides the medical kit and cameras, we have nothing
but our uniforms and our weapons.
Half of us stay to guard Peeta or keep an eye out for
Snow's broadcast, while the others hunt for something to
eat. Messalla proves most valuable because he lived in a
near replica of this apartment and knows where people
would be most likely to stash food. Like how there's a
storage space concealed by a mirrored panel in the
bedroom, or how easy it is to pop out the ventilation screen
in the hallway. So even though the kitchen cupboards are
bare, we find over thirty canned goods and several boxes
of cookies.
The hoarding disgusts the soldiers raised in 13. "Isn't
this illegal?" says Leeg 1.
"On the contrary, in the Capitol you'd be considered
stupid not to do it," says Messalla. "Even before the
Quarter Quell, people were starting to stock up on scarce
supplies."
"While others went without," says Leeg 1.
"Right," says Messalla. "That's how it works here."
"Fortunately, or we wouldn't have dinner," says Gale.
"Everybody grab a can."
Some of our company seem reluctant to do this, but it's
as good a method as any. I'm really not in the mood to divvy
up everything into eleven equal parts, factoring in age, body
weight, and physical output. I poke around in the pile, about
to settle on some cod chowder, when Peeta holds out a
can to me. "Here."
I take it, not knowing what to expect. The label reads
Lamb Stew.
I press my lips together at the memories of rain
dripping through stones, my inept attempts at flirting, and
the aroma of my favorite Capitol dish in the chilly air. So
some part of it must still be in his head, too. How happy,
how hungry, how close we were when that picnic basket
arrived outside our cave. "Thanks." I pop open the top. "It
even has dried plums." I bend the lid and use it as a
makeshift spoon, scooping a bit into my mouth. Now this
place tastes like the arena, too.
We're passing around a box of fancy cream-filled
cookies when the beeping starts again. The seal of Panem
lights up on the screen and remains there while the anthem
plays. And then they begin to show images of the dead, just
as they did with the tributes in the arena. They start with the
four faces of our TV crew, followed by Boggs, Gale,
Finnick, Peeta, and me. Except for Boggs, they don't
bother with the soldiers from 13, either because they have
no idea who they are or because they know they won't
mean anything to the audience. Then the man himself
appears, seated at his desk, a flag draped behind him, the
fresh white rose gleaming in his lapel. I think he might have
recently had more work done, because his lips are puffier
than usual. And his prep team really needs to use a lighter
hand with his blush.
Snow congratulates the Peacekeepers on a masterful
job, honors them for ridding the country of the menace
called the Mockingjay. With my death, he predicts a turning
of the tide in the war, since the demoralized rebels have no
one left to follow. And what was I, really? A poor, unstable
girl with a small talent with a bow and arrow. Not a great
thinker, not the mastermind of the rebellion, merely a face
plucked from the rabble because I had caught the nation's
attention with my antics in the Games. But necessary, so
very necessary, because the rebels have no real leader
among them.
Somewhere in District 13, Beetee hits a switch,
because now it's not President Snow but President Coin
who's looking at us. She introduces herself to Panem,
identifies herself as the head of the rebellion, and then
gives my eulogy. Praise for the girl who survived the Seam
and the Hunger Games, then turned a country of slaves into
an army of freedom fighters. "Dead or alive, Katniss
Everdeen will remain the face of this rebellion. If ever you
waver in your resolve, think of the Mockingjay, and in her
you will find the strength you need to rid Panem of its
oppressors."
"I had no idea how much I meant to her," I say, which
brings a laugh from Gale and questioning looks from the
others.
Up comes a heavily doctored photo of me looking
beautiful and fierce with a bunch of flames flickering behind
me. No words. No slogan. My face is all they need now.
Beetee gives the reins back to a very controlled Snow.
I have the feeling the president thought the emergency
channel was impenetrable, and someone will end up dead
tonight because it was breached. "Tomorrow morning,
when we pull Katniss Everdeen's body from the ashes, we
will see exactly who the Mockingjay is. A dead girl who
could save no one, not even herself." Seal, anthem, and
out.
"Except that you won't find her," says Finnick to the
empty screen, voicing what we're all probably thinking. The
grace period will be brief. Once they dig through those
ashes and come up missing eleven bodies, they'll know we
escaped.
"We can get a head start on them at least," I say.
Suddenly, I'm so tired. All I want is to lie down on a nearby
green plush sofa and go to sleep. To cocoon myself in a
comforter made of rabbit fur and goose down. Instead, I pull
out the Holo and insist that Jackson talk me through the
most basic commands--which are really about entering the
coordinates of the nearest map grid intersection--so that I
can at least begin to operate the thing myself. As the Holo
projects our surroundings, I feel my heart sink even further.
We must be moving closer to crucial targets, because the
number of pods has noticeably increased. How can we
possibly move forward into this bouquet of blinking lights
without detection? We can't. And if we can't, we are
trapped like birds in a net. I decide it's best not to adopt
some sort of superior attitude when I'm with these people.
Especially when my eyes keep drifting to that green sofa.
So I say, "Any ideas?"
"Why don't we start by ruling out possibilities," says
Finnick. "The street is not a possibility."
"The rooftops are just as bad as the street," says Leeg
1.
"We still might have a chance to withdraw, go back the
way we came," says Homes. "But that would mean a failed
mission."
A pang of guilt hits me since I've fabricated said
mission. "It was never intended for all of us to go forward.
You just had the misfortune to be with me."
"Well, that's a moot point. We're with you now," says
Jackson. "So, we can't stay put. We can't move up. We
can't move laterally. I think that just leaves one option."
"Underground," says Gale.
Underground. Which I hate. Like mines and tunnels
and 13. Underground, where I dread dying, which is stupid
because even if I die aboveground, the next thing they'll do
is bury me underground anyway.
The Holo can show subterranean as well as streetlevel
pods. I see that when we go underground the clean,
dependable lines of the street plan are interlaced with a
twisting, turning mess of tunnels. The pods look less
numerous, though.
Two doors down, a vertical tube connects our row of
apartments to the tunnels. To reach the tube apartment, we
will need to squeeze through a maintenance shaft that runs
the length of the building. We can enter the shaft through the
back of a closet space on the upper floor.
"Okay, then. Let's make it look like we've never been
here," I say. We erase all signs of our stay. Send the empty
cans down a trash chute, pocket the full ones for later, flip
sofa cushions smeared with blood, wipe traces of gel from
the tiles. There's no fixing the latch on the front door, but we
lock a second bolt, which will at least keep the door from
swinging open on contact.
Finally, there's only Peeta to contend with. He plants
himself on the blue sofa, refusing to budge. "I'm not going.
I'll either disclose your position or hurt someone else."
"Snow's people will find you," says Finnick.
"Then leave me a pill. I'll only take it if I have to," says
Peeta.
"That's not an option. Come along," says Jackson.
"Or you'll what? Shoot me?" asks Peeta.
"We'll knock you out and drag you with us," says
Homes. "Which will both slow us down and endanger us."
"Stop being noble! I don't care if I die!" He turns to me,
pleading now. "Katniss, please. Don't you see, I want to be
out of this?"
The trouble is, I do see. Why can't I just let him go? Slip
him a pill, pull the trigger? Is it because I care too much
about Peeta or too much about letting Snow win? Have I
turned him into a piece in my private Games? That's
despicable, but I'm not sure it's beneath me. If it's true, it
would be kindest to kill Peeta here and now. But for better
or worse, I am not motivated by kindness. "We're wasting
time. Are you coming voluntarily or do we knock you out?"
Peeta buries his face in his hands for a few moments,
then rises to join us.
"Should we free his hands?" asks Leeg 1.
"No!" Peeta growls at her, drawing his cuffs in close to
his body.
"No," I echo. "But I want the key." Jackson passes it
over without a word. I slip it into my pants pocket, where it
clicks against the pearl.
When Homes pries open the small metal door to the
maintenance shaft, we encounter another problem. There's
no way the insect shells will be able to fit through the narrow
passage. Castor and Pollux remove them and detach
emergency backup cameras. Each is the size of a shoe
box and probably works about as well. Messalla can't think
of anywhere better to hide the bulky shells, so we end up
dumping them in the closet. Leaving such an easy trail to
follow frustrates me, but what else can we do?
Even going single file, holding our packs and gear out
to the side, it's a tight fit. We sidestep our way past the first
apartment, and break into the second. In this apartment,
one of the bedrooms has a door marked utility instead of a
bathroom. Behind the door is the room with the entrance to
the tube.
Messalla frowns at the wide circular cover, for a
moment returning to his own fussy world. "It's why no one
ever wants the center unit. Workmen coming and going
whenever and no second bath. But the rent's considerably
cheaper." Then he notices Finnick's amused expression
and adds, "Never mind."
The tube cover's simple to unlatch. A wide ladder with
rubber treads on the steps allows for a swift, easy descent
into the bowels of the city. We gather at the foot of the
ladder, waiting for our eyes to adjust to the dim strips of
lights, breathing in the mixture of chemicals, mildew, and
sewage.
Pollux, pale and sweaty, reaches out and latches on to
Castor's wrist. Like he might fall over if there isn't someone
to steady him.
"My brother worked down here after he became an
Avox," says Castor. Of course. Who else would they get to
maintain these dank, evil-smelling passages mined with
pods? "Took five years before we were able to buy his way
up to ground level. Didn't see the sun once."
Under better conditions, on a day with fewer horrors
and more rest, someone would surely know what to say.
Instead we all stand there for a long time trying to formulate
a response.
Finally, Peeta turns to Pollux. "Well, then you just
became our most valuable asset." Castor laughs and
Pollux manages a smile.
We're halfway down the first tunnel when I realize what
was so remarkable about the exchange. Peeta sounded
like his old self, the one who could always think of the right
thing to say when nobody else could. Ironic, encouraging, a
little funny, but not at anyone's expense. I glance back at
him as he trudges along under his guards, Gale and
Jackson, his eyes fixed on the ground, his shoulders
hunched forward. So dispirited. But for a moment, he was
really here.
Peeta called it right. Pollux turns out to be worth ten
Holos. There is a simple network of wide tunnels that
directly corresponds to the main street plan above,
underlying the major avenues and cross streets. It's called
the Transfer, since small trucks use it to deliver goods
around the city. During the day, its many pods are
deactivated, but at night it's a minefield. However, hundreds
of additional passages, utility shafts, train tracks, and
drainage tubes form a multilevel maze. Pollux knows details
that would lead to disaster for a newcomer, like which
offshoots might require gas masks or have live wires or
rats the size of beavers. He alerts us to the gush of water
that sweeps through the sewers periodically, anticipates
the time the Avoxes will be changing shifts, leads us into
damp, obscure pipes to dodge the nearly silent passage of
cargo trains. Most important, he has knowledge of the
cameras. There aren't many down in this gloomy, misty
place, except in the Transfer. But we keep well out of their
way.
Under Pollux's guidance we make good time--
remarkable time, if you compare it to our aboveground
travel. After about six hours, fatigue takes over. It's three in
the morning, so I figure we still have a few hours before our
bodies are discovered missing, they search through the
rubble of the whole block of apartments in case we tried to
escape through the shafts, and the hunt begins.
When I suggest we rest, no one objects. Pollux finds a
small, warm room humming with machines loaded with
levers and dials. He holds up his fingers to indicate we
must be gone in four hours. Jackson works out a guard
schedule, and, since I'm not on the first shift, I wedge myself
in the tight space between Gale and Leeg 1 and go right to
sleep.
It seems like only minutes later when Jackson shakes
me awake, tells me I'm on watch. It's six o'clock, and in one
hour we must be on our way. Jackson tells me to eat a can
of food and keep an eye on Pollux, who's insisted on being
on guard the entire night. "He can't sleep down here." I drag
myself into a state of relative alertness, eat a can of potato
and bean stew, and sit against the wall facing the door.
Pollux seems wide awake. He's probably been reliving
those five years of imprisonment all night. I get out the Holo
and manage to input our grid coordinates and scan the
tunnels. As expected, more pods are registering the closer
we move toward the center of the Capitol. For a while,
Pollux and I click around on the Holo, seeing what traps lie
where. When my head begins to spin, I hand it over to him
and lean back against the wall. I look down at the sleeping
soldiers, crew, and friends, and I wonder how many of us
will ever see the sun again.
When my eyes fall on Peeta, whose head rests right by
my feet, I see he's awake. I wish I could read what's going
on in his mind, that I could go in and untangle the mess of
lies. Then I settle for something I can accomplish.
"Have you eaten?" I ask. A slight shake of his head
indicates he hasn't. I open a can of chicken and rice soup
and hand it to him, keeping the lid in case he tries to slit his
wrists with it or something. He sits up and tilts the can,
chugging back the soup without really bothering to chew it.
The bottom of the can reflects the lights from the machines,
and I remember something that's been itching at the back
of my mind since yesterday. "Peeta, when you asked about
what happened to Darius and Lavinia, and Boggs told you
it was real, you said you thought so. Because there was
nothing shiny about it. What did you mean?"
"Oh. I don't know exactly how to explain it," he tells me.
"In the beginning, everything was just complete confusion.
Now I can sort certain things out. I think there's a pattern
emerging. The memories they altered with the tracker
jacker venom have this strange quality about them. Like
they're too intense or the images aren't stable. You
remember what it was like when we were stung?"
"Trees shattered. There were giant colored butterflies.
I fell in a pit of orange bubbles." I think about it. "Shiny
orange bubbles."
"Right. But nothing about Darius or Lavinia was like
that. I don't think they'd given me any venom yet," he says.
"Well, that's good, isn't it?" I ask. "If you can separate
the two, then you can figure out what's true."
"Yes. And if I could grow wings, I could fly. Only people
can't grow wings," he says. "Real or not real?"
"Real," I say. "But people don't need wings to survive."
"Mockingjays do." He finishes the soup and returns the
can to me.
In the fluorescent light, the circles under his eyes look
like bruises. "There's still time. You should sleep."
Unresisting, he lies back down, but just stares at the needle
on one of the dials as it twitches from side to side. Slowly,
as I would with a wounded animal, my hand stretches out
and brushes a wave of hair from his forehead. He freezes
at my touch, but doesn't recoil. So I continue to gently
smooth back his hair. It's the first time I have voluntarily
touched him since the last arena.
"You're still trying to protect me. Real or not real," he
whispers.
"Real," I answer. It seems to require more explanation.
"Because that's what you and I do. Protect each other."
After a minute or so, he drifts off to sleep.
Shortly before seven, Pollux and I move among the
others, rousing them. There are the usual yawns and sighs
that accompany waking. But my ears are picking up
something else, too. Almost like a hissing. Perhaps it's only
steam escaping a pipe or the far-off whoosh of one of the
trains....
I hush the group to get a better read on it. There's a
hissing, yes, but it's not one extended sound. More like
multiple exhalations that form words. A single word.
Echoing throughout the tunnels. One word. One name.
Repeated over and over again.
"Katniss."
22
The grace period has ended. Perhaps Snow had them
digging through the night. As soon as the fire died down,
anyway. They found Boggs's remains, briefly felt reassured,
and then, as the hours went by without further trophies,
began to suspect. At some point, they realized that they
had been tricked. And President Snow can't tolerate being
made to look like a fool. It doesn't matter whether they
tracked us to the second apartment or assumed we went
directly underground. They know we are down here now
and they've unleashed something, a pack of mutts
probably, bent on finding me.
"Katniss." I jump at the proximity of the sound. Look
frantically for its source, bow loaded, seeking a target to hit.
"Katniss." Peeta's lips are barely moving, but there's no
doubt, the name came out of him. Just when I thought he
seemed a little better, when I thought he might be inching
his way back to me, here is proof of how deep Snow's
poison went. "Katniss." Peeta's programmed to respond to
the hissing chorus, to join in the hunt. He's beginning to stir.
There's no choice. I position my arrow to penetrate his
brain. He'll barely feel a thing. Suddenly, he's sitting up,
eyes wide in alarm, short of breath. "Katniss!" He whips his
head toward me but doesn't seem to notice my bow, the
waiting arrow. "Katniss! Get out of here!"
I hesitate. His voice is alarmed, but not insane. "Why?
What's making that sound?"
"I don't know. Only that it has to kill you," says Peeta.
"Run! Get out! Go!"
After my own moment of confusion, I conclude I do not
have to shoot him. Relax my bowstring. Take in the anxious
faces around me. "Whatever it is, it's after me. It might be a
good time to split up."
"But we're your guard," says Jackson.
"And your crew," adds Cressida.
"I'm not leaving you," Gale says.
I look at the crew, armed with nothing but cameras and
clipboards. And there's Finnick with two guns and a trident.
I suggest that he give one of his guns to Castor. Eject the
blank cartridge from Peeta's, load it with a real one, and
arm Pollux. Since Gale and I have our bows, we hand our
guns over to Messalla and Cressida. There's no time to
show them anything but how to point and pull the trigger, but
in close quarters, that might be enough. It's better than
being defenseless. Now the only one without a weapon is
Peeta, but anyone whispering my name with a bunch of
mutts doesn't need one anyway.
We leave the room free of everything but our scent.
There's no way to erase that at the moment. I'm guessing
that's how the hissing things are tracking us, because we
haven't left much of a physical trail. The mutts' noses will be
abnormally keen, but possibly the time we spent slogging
through water in drainpipes will help throw them.
Outside the hum of the room, the hissing becomes
more distinct. But it's also possible to get a better sense of
the mutts' location. They're behind us, still a fair distance.
Snow probably had them released underground near the
place where he found Boggs's body. Theoretically, we
should have a good lead on them, although they're certain
to be much faster than we are. My mind wanders to the
wolflike creatures in the first arena, the monkeys in the
Quarter Quell, the monstrosities I've witnessed on television
over the years, and I wonder what form these mutts will
take. Whatever Snow thinks will scare me the most.
Pollux and I have worked out a plan for the next leg of
our journey, and since it heads away from the hissing, I see
no reason to alter it. If we move swiftly, maybe we can
reach Snow's mansion before the mutts reach us. But
there's a sloppiness that comes with speed: the poorly
placed boot that results in a splash, the accidental clang of
a gun against a pipe, even my own commands, issued too
loudly for discretion.
We've covered about three more blocks via an
overflow pipe and a section of neglected train track when
the screams begin. Thick, guttural. Bouncing off the tunnel
walls.
"Avoxes," says Peeta immediately. "That's what
Darius sounded like when they tortured him."
"The mutts must have found them," says Cressida.
"So they're not just after Katniss," says Leeg 1.
"They'll probably kill anyone. It's just that they won't stop
until they get to her," says Gale. After his hours studying
with Beetee, he is most likely right.
And here I am again. With people dying because of
me. Friends, allies, complete strangers, losing their lives for
the Mockingjay. "Let me go on alone. Lead them off. I'll
transfer the Holo to Jackson. The rest of you can finish the
mission."
"No one's going to agree to that!" says Jackson in
exasperation.
"We're wasting time!" says Finnick.
"Listen," Peeta whispers.
The screams have stopped, and in their absence my
name has rebounded, startling in its proximity. It's below as
well as behind us now. "Katniss."
I nudge Pollux on the shoulder and we start to run.
Trouble is, we had planned to descend to a lower level, but
that's out now. When we come to the steps leading down,
Pollux and I are scanning for a possible alternative on the
Holo when I start gagging.
"Masks on!" orders Jackson.
There's no need for masks. Everyone is breathing the
same air. I'm the only one losing my stew because I'm the
only one reacting to the odor. Drifting up from the stairwell.
Cutting through the sewage. Roses. I begin to tremble.
I swerve away from the smell and stumble right out
onto the Transfer. Smooth, pastel-colored tiled streets, just
like the ones above, but bordered by white brick walls
instead of homes. A roadway where delivery vehicles can
drive with ease, without the congestion of the Capitol.
Empty now, of everything but us. I swing up my bow and
blow up the first pod with an explosive arrow, which kills the
nest of flesh-eating rats inside. Then I sprint for the next
intersection, where I know one false step will cause the
ground beneath our feet to disintegrate, feeding us into
something labeled Meat Grinder. I shout a warning to the
others to stay with me. I plan for us to skirt around the
corner and then detonate the Meat Grinder, but another
unmarked pod lies in wait.
It happens silently. I would miss it entirely if Finnick
didn't pull me to a stop. "Katniss!"
I whip back around, arrow poised for flight, but what
can be done? Two of Gale's arrows already lie useless
beside the wide shaft of golden light that radiates from
ceiling to floor. Inside, Messalla is as still as a statue,
poised up on the ball of one foot, head tilted back, held
captive by the beam. I can't tell if he's yelling, although his
mouth is stretched wide. We watch, utterly helpless, as the
flesh melts off his body like candle wax.
"Can't help him!" Peeta starts shoving people forward.
"Can't!" Amazingly, he's the only one still functional enough
to get us moving. I don't know why he's in control, when he
should be flipping out and bashing my brains in, but that
could happen any second. At the pressure of his hand
against my shoulder, I turn away from the grisly thing that
was Messalla; I make my feet go forward, fast, so fast that I
can barely skid to a stop before the next intersection.
A spray of gunfire brings down a shower of plaster. I
jerk my head from side to side, looking for the pod, before I
turn and see the squad of Peacekeepers pounding down
the Transfer toward us. With the Meat Grinder pod blocking
our way, there's nothing to do but fire back. They outnumber
us two to one, but we've still got six original members of the
Star Squad, who aren't trying to run and shoot at the same
time.
Fish in a barrel, I think, as blossoms of red stain their
white uniforms. Three-quarters of them are down and dead
when more begin to pour in from the side of the tunnel, the
same one I flung myself through to get away from the smell,
from the--
Those aren't Peacekeepers.
They are white, four-limbed, about the size of a fullgrown
human, but that's where the comparisons stop.
Naked, with long reptilian tails, arched backs, and heads
that jut forward. They swarm over the Peacekeepers, living
and dead, clamp on to their necks with their mouths and rip
off the helmeted heads. Apparently, having a Capitol
pedigree is as useless here as it was in 13. It seems to
take only seconds before the Peacekeepers are
decapitated. The mutts fall to their bellies and skitter toward
us on all fours.
"This way!" I shout, hugging the wall and making a
sharp right turn to avoid the pod. When everyone's joined
me, I fire into the intersection, and the Meat Grinder
activates. Huge mechanical teeth burst through the street
and chew the tile to dust. That should make it impossible
for the mutts to follow us, but I don't know. The wolf and
monkey mutts I've encountered could leap unbelievably far.
The hissing burns my ears, and the reek of roses
makes the walls spin.
I grab Pollux's arm. "Forget the mission. What's the
quickest way aboveground?"
There's no time for checking the Holo. We follow Pollux
for about ten yards along the Transfer and go through a
doorway. I'm aware of tile changing to concrete, of crawling
through a tight, stinking pipe onto a ledge about a foot
wide. We're in the main sewer. A yard below, a poisonous
brew of human waste, garbage, and chemical runoff
bubbles by us. Parts of the surface are on fire, others emit
evil-looking clouds of vapor. One look tells you that if you fall
in, you're never coming out. Moving as quickly as we dare
on the slippery ledge, we make our way to a narrow bridge
and cross it. In an alcove at the far side, Pollux smacks a
ladder with his hand and points up the shaft. This is it. Our
way out.
A quick glance at our party tells me something's off.
"Wait! Where are Jackson and Leeg One?"
"They stayed at the Grinder to hold the mutts back,"
says Homes.
"What?" I'm lunging back for the bridge, willing to leave
no one to those monsters, when he yanks me back.
"Don't waste their lives, Katniss. It's too late for them.
Look!" Homes nods to the pipe, where the mutts are
slithering onto the ledge.
"Stand back!" Gale shouts. With his explosive-tipped
arrows, he rips the far side of the bridge from its
foundation. The rest sinks into the bubbles, just as the mutts
reach it.
For the first time, I get a good look at them. A mix of
human and lizard and who knows what else. White, tight
reptilian skin smeared with gore, clawed hands and feet,
their faces a mess of conflicting features. Hissing, shrieking
my name now, as their bodies contort in rage. Lashing out
with tails and claws, taking huge chunks of one another or
their own bodies with wide, lathered mouths, driven mad by
their need to destroy me. My scent must be as evocative to
them as theirs is to me. More so, because despite its
toxicity, the mutts begin to throw themselves into the foul
sewer.
Along our bank, everyone opens fire. I choose my
arrows without discretion, sending arrowheads, fire,
explosives into the mutts' bodies. They're mortal, but only
just. No natural thing could keep coming with two dozen
bullets in it. Yes, we can eventually kill them, only there are
so many, an endless supply pouring from the pipe, not even
hesitating to take to the sewage.
But it's not their numbers that make my hands shake
so.
No mutt is good. All are meant to damage you. Some
take your life, like the monkeys. Others your reason, like the
tracker jackers. However, the true atrocities, the most
frightening, incorporate a perverse psychological twist
designed to terrify the victim. The sight of the wolf mutts
with the dead tributes' eyes. The sound of the jabberjays
replicating Prim's tortured screams. The smell of Snow's
roses mixed with the victims' blood. Carried across the
sewer. Cutting through even this foulness. Making my heart
run wild, my skin turn to ice, my lungs unable to suck air. It's
as if Snow's breathing right in my face, telling me it's time to
die.
The others are shouting at me, but I can't seem to
respond. Strong arms lift me as I blast the head off a mutt
whose claws have just grazed my ankle. I'm slammed into
the ladder. Hands shoved against the rungs. Ordered to
climb. My wooden, puppet limbs obey. Movement slowly
brings me back to my senses. I detect one person above
me. Pollux. Peeta and Cressida are below. We reach a
platform. Switch to a second ladder. Rungs slick with sweat
and mildew. At the next platform, my head has cleared and
the reality of what's happened hits me. I begin frantically
pulling people up off the ladder. Peeta. Cressida. That's it.
What have I done? What have I abandoned the others
to? I'm scrambling back down the ladder when one of my
boots kicks someone.
"Climb!" Gale barks at me. I'm back up, hauling him in,
peering into the gloom for more. "No." Gale turns my face
to him and shakes his head. Uniform shredded. Gaping
wound in the side of his neck.
There's a human cry from below. "Someone's still
alive," I plead.
"No, Katniss. They're not coming," says Gale. "Only the
mutts are."
Unable to accept it, I shine the light from Cressida's
gun down the shaft. Far below, I can just make out Finnick,
struggling to hang on as three mutts tear at him. As one
yanks back his head to take the death bite, something
bizarre happens. It's as if I'm Finnick, watching images of
my life flash by. The mast of a boat, a silver parachute,
Mags laughing, a pink sky, Beetee's trident, Annie in her
wedding dress, waves breaking over rocks. Then it's over.
I slide the Holo from my belt and choke out "nightlock,
nightlock, nightlock." Release it. Hunch against the wall with
the others as the explosion rocks the platform and bits of
mutt and human flesh shoot out of the pipe and shower us.
There's a clank as Pollux slams a cover over the pipe
and locks it in place. Pollux, Gale, Cressida, Peeta, and
me. We're all that's left. Later, the human feelings will come.
Now I'm conscious only of an animal need to keep the
remnants of our band alive. "We can't stop here."
Someone comes up with a bandage. We tie it around
Gale's neck. Get him to his feet. Only one figure stays
huddled against the wall. "Peeta," I say. There's no
response. Has he blacked out? I crouch in front of him,
pulling his cuffed hands from his face. "Peeta?" His eyes
are like black pools, the pupils dilated so that the blue
irises have all but vanished. The muscles in his wrists are
hard as metal.
"Leave me," he whispers. "I can't hang on."
"Yes. You can!" I tell him.
Peeta shakes his head. "I'm losing it. I'll go mad. Like
them."
Like the mutts. Like a rabid beast bent on ripping my
throat out. And here, finally here in this place, in these
circumstances, I will really have to kill him. And Snow will
win. Hot, bitter hatred courses through me. Snow has won
too much already today.
It's a long shot, it's suicide maybe, but I do the only
thing I can think of. I lean in and kiss Peeta full on the mouth.
His whole body starts shuddering, but I keep my lips
pressed to his until I have to come up for air. My hands
slide up his wrists to clasp his. "Don't let him take you from
me."
Peeta's panting hard as he fights the nightmares
raging in his head. "No. I don't want to..."
I clench his hands to the point of pain. "Stay with me."
His pupils contract to pinpoints, dilate again rapidly,
and then return to something resembling normalcy.
"Always," he murmurs.
I help Peeta up and address Pollux. "How far to the
street?" He indicates it's just above us. I climb the last
ladder and push open the lid to someone's utility room. I'm
rising to my feet when a woman throws open the door. She
wears a bright turquoise silk robe embroidered with exotic
birds. Her magenta hair's fluffed up like a cloud and
decorated with gilded butterflies. Grease from the halfeaten
sausage she's holding smears her lipstick. The
expression on her face says she recognizes me. She
opens her mouth to call for help.
Without hesitation, I shoot her through the heart.
23
Who the woman was calling to remains a mystery,
because after searching the apartment, we find she was
alone. Perhaps her cry was meant for a nearby neighbor, or
was simply an expression of fear. At any rate, there's no
one else to hear her.
This apartment would be a classy place to hole up in
for a while, but that's a luxury we can't afford. "How long do
you think we have before they figure out some of us
could've survived?" I ask.
"I think they could be here anytime," Gale answers.
"They knew we were heading for the streets. Probably the
explosion will throw them for a few minutes, then they'll start
looking for our exit point."
I go to a window that overlooks the street, and when I
peek through the blinds, I'm not faced with Peacekeepers
but with a bundled crowd of people going about their
business. During our underground journey, we have left the
evacuated zones far behind and surfaced in a busy section
of the Capitol. This crowd offers our only chance of escape.
I don't have a Holo, but I have Cressida. She joins me at the
window, confirms she knows our location, and gives me the
good news that we aren't many blocks from the president's
mansion.
One glance at my companions tells me this is no time
for a stealth attack on Snow. Gale's still losing blood from
the neck wound, which we haven't even cleaned. Peeta's
sitting on a velvet sofa with his teeth clamped down on a
pillow, either fighting off madness or containing a scream.
Pollux weeps against the mantel of an ornate fireplace.
Cressida stands determinedly at my side, but she's so pale
her lips are bloodless. I'm running on hate. When the energy
for that ebbs, I'll be worthless.
"Let's check her closets," I say.
In one bedroom we find hundreds of the woman's
outfits, coats, pairs of shoes, a rainbow of wigs, enough
makeup to paint a house. In a bedroom across the hall,
there's a similar selection for men. Perhaps they belong to
her husband. Perhaps to a lover who had the good luck to
be out this morning.
I call the others to dress. At the sight of Peeta's bloody
wrists, I dig in my pocket for the handcuff key, but he jerks
away from me.
"No," he says. "Don't. They help hold me together."
"You might need your hands," says Gale.
"When I feel myself slipping, I dig my wrists into them,
and the pain helps me focus," says Peeta. I let them be.
Fortunately, it's cold out, so we can conceal most of
our uniforms and weapons under flowing coats and cloaks.
We hang our boots around our necks by their laces and
hide them, pull on silly shoes to replace them. The real
challenge, of course, is our faces. Cressida and Pollux run
the risk of being recognized by acquaintances, Gale could
be familiar from the propos and news, and Peeta and I are
known by every citizen of Panem. We hastily help one
another apply thick layers of makeup, pull on wigs and
sunglasses. Cressida wraps scarves over Peeta's and my
mouths and noses.
I can feel the clock ticking away, but stop for just a few
moments to stuff pockets with food and first-aid supplies.
"Stay together," I say at the front door. Then we march right
into the street. Snow flurries have begun to fall. Agitated
people swirl around us, speaking of rebels and hunger and
me in their affected Capitol accents. We cross the street,
pass a few more apartments. Just as we turn the corner,
three dozen Peacekeepers sweep past us. We hop out of
their way, as the real citizens do, wait until the crowd returns
to its normal flow, and keep moving. "Cressida," I whisper.
"Can you think of anywhere?"
"I'm trying," she says.
We cover another block, and the sirens begin. Through
an apartment window, I see an emergency report and
pictures of our faces flashing. They haven't identified who in
our party died yet, because I see Castor and Finnick
among the photos. Soon every passerby will be as
dangerous as a Peacekeeper. "Cressida?"
"There's one place. It's not ideal. But we can try it," she
says. We follow her a few more blocks and turn through a
gate into what looks like a private residence. It's some kind
of shortcut, though, because after walking through a
manicured garden, we come out of another gate onto a
small back street that connects two main avenues. There
are a few poky stores--one that buys used goods, another
that sells fake jewelry. Only a couple of people are around,
and they pay no attention to us. Cressida begins to babble
in a high-pitched voice about fur undergarments, how
essential they are during the cold months. "Wait until you
see the prices! Believe me, it's half what you pay on the
avenues!"
We stop before a grimy storefront filled with
mannequins in furry underwear. The place doesn't even
look open, but Cressida pushes through the front door,
setting off a dissonant chiming. Inside the dim, narrow shop
lined with racks of merchandise, the smell of pelts fills my
nose. Business must be slow, since we're the only
customers. Cressida heads straight for a hunched figure
sitting in the back. I follow, trailing my fingers through the
soft garments as we go.
Behind a counter sits the strangest person I've ever
seen. She's an extreme example of surgical enhancement
gone wrong, for surely not even in the Capitol could they
find this face attractive. The skin has been pulled back
tightly and tattooed with black and gold stripes. The nose
has been flattened until it barely exists. I've seen cat
whiskers on people in the Capitol before, but none so long.
The result is a grotesque, semi-feline mask, which now
squints at us distrustfully.
Cressida takes off her wig, revealing her vines.
"Tigris," she says. "We need help."
Tigris. Deep in my brain, the name rings a bell. She
was a fixture--a younger, less disturbing version of herself--
in the earliest Hunger Games I can remember. A stylist, I
think. I don't remember for which district. Not 12. Then she
must have had one operation too many and crossed the
line into repellence.
So this is where stylists go when they've outlived their
use. To sad theme underwear shops where they wait for
death. Out of the public eye.
I stare at her face, wondering if her parents actually
named her Tigris, inspiring her mutilation, or if she chose
the style and changed her name to match her stripes.
"Plutarch said you could be trusted," adds Cressida.
Great, she's one of Plutarch's people. So if her first
move isn't to turn us in to the Capitol, it will be to notify
Plutarch, and by extension Coin, of our whereabouts. No,
Tigris's shop is not ideal, but it's all we have at the moment.
If she'll even help us. She's peering between an old
television on her counter and us, as if trying to place us. To
help her, I pull down my scarf, remove my wig, and step
closer so that the light of the screen falls on my face.
Tigris gives a low growl, not unlike one Buttercup might
greet me with. She slinks down off her stool and
disappears behind a rack of fur-lined leggings. There's a
sound of sliding, and then her hand emerges and waves us
forward. Cressida looks at me, as if to ask Are you sure?
But what choice do we have? Returning to the streets under
these conditions guarantees our capture or death. I push
around the furs and find Tigris has slid back a panel at the
base of the wall. Behind it seems to be the top of a steep
stone stairway. She gestures for me to enter.
Everything about the situation screams trap. I have a
moment of panic and find myself turning to Tigris, searching
those tawny eyes. Why is she doing this? She's no Cinna,
someone willing to sacrifice herself for others. This woman
was the embodiment of Capitol shallowness. She was one
of the stars of the Hunger Games until...until she wasn't. So
is that it, then? Bitterness? Hatred? Revenge? Actually, I'm
comforted by the idea. A need for revenge can burn long
and hot. Especially if every glance in a mirror reinforces it.
"Did Snow ban you from the Games?" I ask. She just
stares back at me. Somewhere her tiger tail flicks with
displeasure. "Because I'm going to kill him, you know." Her
mouth spreads into what I take for a smile. Reassured that
this isn't complete madness, I crawl through the space.
About halfway down the steps, my face runs into a
hanging chain and I pull it, illuminating the hideout with a
flickering fluorescent bulb. It's a small cellar with no doors or
windows. Shallow and wide. Probably just a strip between
two real basements. A place whose existence could go
unnoticed unless you had a very keen eye for dimensions.
It's cold and dank, with piles of pelts that I'm guessing
haven't seen the light of day in years. Unless Tigris gives us
up, I don't believe anyone will find us here. By the time I
reach the concrete floor, my companions are on the steps.
The panel slides back in place. I hear the underwear rack
being adjusted on squeaky wheels. Tigris padding back to
her stool. We have been swallowed up by her store.
Just in time, too, because Gale looks on the verge of
collapse. We make a bed of pelts, strip off his layers of
weapons, and help him onto his back. At the end of the
cellar, there's a faucet about a foot from the floor with a
drain under it. I turn the tap and, after much sputtering and a
lot of rust, clear water begins to flow. We clean Gale's neck
wound and I realize bandages won't be enough. He's going
to need a few stitches. There's a needle and sterile thread
in the first-aid supplies, but what we lack is a healer. It
crosses my mind to enlist Tigris. As a stylist, she must
know how to work a needle. But that would leave no one
manning the shop, and she's doing enough already. I
accept that I'm probably the most qualified for the job, grit
my teeth, and put in a row of jagged sutures. It's not pretty
but it's functional. I smear it with medicine and wrap it up.
Give him some painkillers. "You can rest now. It's safe
here," I tell him. He goes out like a light.
While Cressida and Pollux make fur nests for each of
us, I attend to Peeta's wrists. Gently rinsing away the blood,
putting on an antiseptic, and bandaging them beneath the
cuffs. "You've got to keep them clean, otherwise the
infection could spread and--"
"I know what blood poisoning is, Katniss," says Peeta.
"Even if my mother isn't a healer."
I'm jolted back in time, to another wound, another set of
bandages. "You said that same thing to me in the first
Hunger Games. Real or not real?"
"Real," he says. "And you risked your life getting the
medicine that saved me?"
"Real." I shrug. "You were the reason I was alive to do
it."
"Was I?" The comment throws him into confusion.
Some shiny memory must be fighting for his attention,
because his body tenses and his newly bandaged wrists
strain against the metal cuffs. Then all the energy saps from
his body. "I'm so tired, Katniss."
"Go to sleep," I say. He won't until I've rearranged his
handcuffs and shackled him to one of the stair supports. It
can't be comfortable, lying there with his arms above his
head. But in a few minutes, he drifts off, too.
Cressida and Pollux have made beds for us, arranged
our food and medical supplies, and now ask what I want to
do about setting up a guard. I look at Gale's pallor, Peeta's
restraints. Pollux hasn't slept for days, and Cressida and I
only napped for a few hours. If a troop of Peacekeepers
were to come through that door, we'd be trapped like rats.
We are completely at the mercy of a decrepit tiger-woman
with what I can only hope is an all-consuming passion for
Snow's death.
"I don't honestly think there's any point in setting up a
guard. Let's just try to get some sleep," I say. They nod
numbly, and we all burrow into our pelts. The fire inside me
has flickered out, and with it my strength. I surrender to the
soft, musty fur and oblivion.
I have only one dream I remember. A long and
wearying thing in which I'm trying to get to District 12. The
home I'm seeking is intact, the people alive. Effie Trinket,
conspicuous in a bright pink wig and tailored outfit, travels
with me. I keep trying to ditch her in places, but she
inexplicably reappears at my side, insisting that as my
escort she's responsible for my staying on schedule. Only
the schedule is constantly shifting, derailed by our lack of a
stamp from an official or delayed when Effie breaks one of
her high heels. We camp for days on a bench in a gray
station in District 7, awaiting a train that never comes.
When I wake, somehow I feel even more drained by this
than my usual nighttime forays into blood and terror.
Cressida, the only person awake, tells me it's late
afternoon. I eat a can of beef stew and wash it down with a
lot of water. Then I lean against the cellar wall, retracing the
events of the last day. Moving death by death. Counting
them up on my fingers. One, two--Mitchell and Boggs lost
on the block. Three--Messalla melted by the pod. Four, five-
-Leeg 1 and Jackson sacrificing themselves at the Meat
Grinder. Six, seven, eight--Castor, Homes, and Finnick
being decapitated by the rose-scented lizard mutts. Eight
dead in twenty-four hours. I know it happened, and yet it
doesn't seem real. Surely, Castor is asleep under that pile
of furs, Finnick will come bounding down the steps in a
minute, Boggs will tell me his plan for our escape.
To believe them dead is to accept I killed them. Okay,
maybe not Mitchell and Boggs--they died on an actual
assignment. But the others lost their lives defending me on
a mission I fabricated. My plot to assassinate Snow seems
so stupid now. So stupid as I sit shivering here in this cellar,
tallying up our losses, fingering the tassels on the silver
knee-high boots I stole from the woman's home. Oh, yeah--I
forgot about that. I killed her, too. I'm taking out unarmed
citizens now.
I think it's time I give myself up.
When everyone finally awakens, I confess. How I lied
about the mission, how I jeopardized everyone in pursuit of
revenge. There's a long silence after I finish. Then Gale
says, "Katniss, we all knew you were lying about Coin
sending you to assassinate Snow."
"You knew, maybe. The soldiers from Thirteen didn't," I
reply."
Do you really think Jackson believed you had orders
from Coin?" Cressida asks. "Of course she didn't. But she
trusted Boggs, and he'd clearly wanted you to go on."
"I never even told Boggs what I planned to do," I say.
"You told everyone in Command!" Gale says. "It was
one of your conditions for being the Mockingjay. 'I kill
Snow.'"
Those seem like two disconnected things. Negotiating
with Coin for the privilege of executing Snow after the war
and this unauthorized flight through the Capitol. "But not like
this," I say. "It's been a complete disaster."
"I think it would be considered a highly successful
mission," says Gale. "We've infiltrated the enemy camp,
showing that the Capitol's defenses can be breached.
We've managed to get footage of ourselves all over the
Capitol's news. We've thrown the whole city into chaos
trying to find us."
"Trust me, Plutarch's thrilled," Cressida adds.
"That's because Plutarch doesn't care who dies," I say.
"Not as long as his Games are a success."
Cressida and Gale go round and round trying to
convince me. Pollux nods at their words to back them up.
Only Peeta doesn't offer an opinion.
"What do you think, Peeta?" I finally ask him.
"I think...you still have no idea. The effect you can
have." He slides his cuffs up the support and pushes
himself to a sitting position. "None of the people we lost
were idiots. They knew what they were doing. They followed
you because they believed you really could kill Snow."
I don't know why his voice reaches me when no one
else's can. But if he's right, and I think he is, I owe the others
a debt that can only be repaid in one way. I pull my paper
map from a pocket in my uniform and spread it out on the
floor with new resolve. "Where are we, Cressida?"
Tigris's shop sits about five blocks from the City Circle
and Snow's mansion. We're in easy walking distance
through a zone in which the pods are deactivated for the
residents' safety. We have disguises that, perhaps with
some embellishments from Tigris's furry stock, could get us
safely there. But then what? The mansion's sure to be
heavily guarded, under round-the-clock camera
surveillance, and laced with pods that could become live at
the flick of a switch.
"What we need is to get him out in the open," Gale
says to me. "Then one of us could pick him off."
"Does he ever appear in public anymore?" asks
Peeta.
"I don't think so," says Cressida. "At least in all the
recent speeches I've seen, he's been in the mansion. Even
before the rebels got here. I imagine he became more
vigilant after Finnick aired his crimes."
That's right. It's not just the Tigrises of the Capitol who
hate Snow now, but a web of people who know what he did
to their friends and families. It would have to be something
bordering on miraculous to lure him out. Something like...
"I bet he'd come out for me," I say. "If I were captured.
He'd want that as public as possible. He'd want my
execution on his front steps." I let this sink in. "Then Gale
could shoot him from the audience."
"No." Peeta shakes his head. "There are too many
alternative endings to that plan. Snow might decide to keep
you and torture information out of you. Or have you
executed publicly without being present. Or kill you inside
the mansion and display your body out front."
"Gale?" I say.
"It seems like an extreme solution to jump to
immediately," he says. "Maybe if all else fails. Let's keep
thinking."
In the quiet that follows, we hear Tigris's soft footfall
overhead. It must be closing time. She's locking up,
fastening the shutters maybe. A few minutes later, the panel
at the top of the stairs slides open.
"Come up," says a gravelly voice. "I have some food
for you." It's the first time she's talked since we arrived.
Whether it's natural or from years of practice, I don't know,
but there's something in her manner of speaking that
suggests a cat's purr.
As we climb the stairs, Cressida asks, "Did you
contact Plutarch, Tigris?"
"No way to." Tigris shrugs. "He'll figure out you're in a
safe house. Don't worry."
Worry? I feel immensely relieved by the news that I
won't be given--and have to ignore--direct orders from 13.
Or make up some viable defense for the decisions I've
made over the last couple of days.
In the shop, the counter holds some stale hunks of
bread, a wedge of moldy cheese, and half a bottle of
mustard. It reminds me that not everyone in the Capitol has
full stomachs these days. I feel obliged to tell Tigris about
our remaining food supplies, but she waves my objections
away. "I eat next to nothing," she says. "And then, only raw
meat." This seems a little too in character, but I don't
question it. I just scrape the mold off the cheese and divide
up the food among the rest of us.
While we eat, we watch the latest Capitol news
coverage. The government has the rebel survivors
narrowed down to the five of us. Huge bounties are offered
for information leading to our capture. They emphasize how
dangerous we are. Show us exchanging gunfire with the
Peacekeepers, although not the mutts ripping off their
heads. Do a tragic tribute to the woman lying where we left
her, with my arrow still in her heart. Someone has redone
her makeup for the cameras.
The rebels let the Capitol broadcast run on
uninterrupted. "Have the rebels made a statement today?" I
ask Tigris. She shakes her head. "I doubt Coin knows what
to do with me now that I'm still alive."
Tigris gives a throaty cackle. "No one knows what to
do with you, girlie." Then she makes me take a pair of the
fur leggings even though I can't pay her for them. It's the
kind of gift you have to accept. And anyway, it's cold in that
cellar.Downstairs after supper, we continue to rack our
brains for a plan. Nothing good comes up, but we do agree
that we can no longer go out as a group of five and that we
should try to infiltrate the president's mansion before I turn
myself into bait. I consent to that second point to avoid
further argument. If I do decide to give myself up, it won't
require anyone else's permission or participation.
We change bandages, handcuff Peeta back to his
support, and settle down to sleep. A few hours later, I slip
back into consciousness and become aware of a quiet
conversation. Peeta and Gale. I can't stop myself from
eavesdropping.
"Thanks for the water," Peeta says.
"No problem," Gale replies. "I wake up ten times a
night anyway."
"To make sure Katniss is still here?" asks Peeta.
"Something like that," Gale admits.
There's a long pause before Peeta speaks again.
"That was funny, what Tigris said. About no one knowing
what to do with her."
"Well, we never have," Gale says.
They both laugh. It's so strange to hear them talking
like this. Almost like friends. Which they're not. Never have
been. Although they're not exactly enemies.
"She loves you, you know," says Peeta. "She as good
as told me after they whipped you."
"Don't believe it," Gale answers. "The way she kissed
you in the Quarter Quell...well, she never kissed me like
that."
"It was just part of the show," Peeta tells him, although
there's an edge of doubt in his voice.
"No, you won her over. Gave up everything for her.
Maybe that's the only way to convince her you love her."
There's a long pause. "I should have volunteered to take
your place in the first Games. Protected her then."
"You couldn't," says Peeta. "She'd never have forgiven
you. You had to take care of her family. They matter more to
her than her life."
"Well, it won't be an issue much longer. I think it's
unlikely all three of us will be alive at the end of the war. And
if we are, I guess it's Katniss's problem. Who to choose."
Gale yawns. "We should get some sleep."
"Yeah." I hear Peeta's handcuffs slide down the
support as he settles in. "I wonder how she'll make up her
mind."
"Oh, that I do know." I can just catch Gale's last words
through the layer of fur. "Katniss will pick whoever she
thinks she can't survive without."
24
A chill runs through me. Am I really that cold and
calculating? Gale didn't say, "Katniss will pick whoever it
will break her heart to give up," or even "whoever she can't
live without." Those would have implied I was motivated by
a kind of passion. But my best friend predicts I will choose
the person who I think I "can't survive without." There's not
the least indication that love, or desire, or even
compatibility will sway me. I'll just conduct an unfeeling
assessment of what my potential mates can offer me. As if
in the end, it will be the question of whether a baker or a
hunter will extend my longevity the most. It's a horrible thing
for Gale to say, for Peeta not to refute. Especially when
every emotion I have has been taken and exploited by the
Capitol or the rebels. At the moment, the choice would be
simple. I can survive just fine without either of them.
In the morning, I have no time or energy to nurse
wounded feelings. During a predawn breakfast of liver pate
and fig cookies, we gather around Tigris's television for
one of Beetee's break-ins. There's been a new
development in the war. Apparently inspired by the black
wave, some enterprising rebel commander came up with
the idea of confiscating people's abandoned automobiles
and sending them unmanned down the streets. The cars
don't trigger every pod, but they certainly get the majority. At
around four in the morning, the rebels began carving three
separate paths--simply referred to as the A, B, and C lines-
-to the Capitol's heart. As a result, they've secured block
after block with very few casualties.
"This can't last," says Gale. "In fact I'm surprised
they've kept it going so long. The Capitol will adjust by
deactivating specific pods and then manually triggering
them when their targets come in range." Almost within
minutes of his prediction, we see this very thing happen onscreen.
A squad sends a car down a block, setting off four
pods. All seems well. Three scouts follow and make it
safely to the end of the street. But when a group of twenty
rebel soldiers follow them, they're blown to bits by a row of
potted rosebushes in front of a flower shop.
"I bet it's killing Plutarch not to be in the control room
on this one," says Peeta.
Beetee gives the broadcast back to the Capitol, where
a grim-faced reporter announces the blocks that civilians
are to evacuate. Between her update and the previous
story, I am able to mark my paper map to show the relative
positions of the opposing armies.
I hear scuffling out on the street, move to the windows,
and peek out a crack in the shutters. In the early morning
light, I see a bizarre spectacle. Refugees from the now
occupied blocks are streaming toward the Capitol's center.
The most panicked are wearing nothing but nightgowns
and slippers, while the more prepared are heavily bundled
in layers of clothes. They carry everything from lapdogs to
jewelry boxes to potted plants. One man in a fluffy robe
holds only an overripe banana. Confused, sleepy children
stumble along after their parents, most either too stunned or
too baffled to cry. Bits of them flash by my line of vision. A
pair of wide brown eyes. An arm clutching a favorite doll. A
pair of bare feet, bluish in the cold, catching on the uneven
paving stones of the alley. Seeing them reminds me of the
children of 12 who died fleeing the firebombs. I leave the
window.
Tigris offers to be our spy for the day since she's the
only one of us without a bounty on her head. After securing
us downstairs, she goes out into the Capitol to pick up any
helpful information.
Down in the cellar I pace back and forth, driving the
others crazy. Something tells me that not taking advantage
of the flood of refugees is a mistake. What better cover
could we have? On the other hand, every displaced person
milling about on the streets means another pair of eyes
looking for the five rebels on the loose. Then again, what do
we gain by staying here? All we're really doing is depleting
our small cache of food and waiting for...what? The rebels
to take the Capitol? It could be weeks before that happens,
and I'm not so sure what I'd do if they did. Not run out and
greet them. Coin would have me whisked back to 13
before I could say "nightlock, nightlock, nightlock." I did not
come all this way, and lose all those people, to turn myself
over to that woman. I kill Snow. Besides, there would be an
awful lot of things I couldn't easily explain about the last few
days. Several of which, if they came to light, would probably
blow my deal for the victors' immunity right out of the water.
And forget about me, I've got a feeling some of the others
are going to need it. Like Peeta. Who, no matter how you
spin it, can be seen on tape tossing Mitchell into that net
pod. I can imagine what Coin's war tribunal will do with that.
By late afternoon, we're beginning to get uneasy about
Tigris's long absence. Talk turns to the possibilities that she
has been apprehended and arrested, turned us in
voluntarily, or simply been injured in the wave of refugees.
But around six o'clock we hear her return. There's some
shuffling around upstairs, then she opens the panel. The
wonderful smell of frying meat fills the air. Tigris has
prepared us a hash of chopped ham and potatoes. It's the
first hot food we've had in days, and as I wait for her to fill
my plate, I'm in danger of actually drooling.
As I chew, I try to pay attention to Tigris telling us how
she acquired it, but the main thing I absorb is that fur
underwear is a valuable trading item at the moment.
Especially for people who left their homes underdressed.
Many are still out on the street, trying to find shelter for the
night. Those who live in the choice apartments of the inner
city have not flung open their doors to house the displaced.
On the contrary, most of them bolted their locks, drew their
shutters, and pretended to be out. Now the City Circle's
packed with refugees, and the Peacekeepers are going
door to door, breaking into places if they have to, to assign
houseguests.
On the television, we watch a terse Head
Peacekeeper lay out specific rules regarding how many
people per square foot each resident will be expected to
take in. He reminds the citizens of the Capitol that
temperatures will drop well below freezing tonight and
warns them that their president expects them to be not only
willing but enthusiastic hosts in this time of crisis. Then they
show some very staged-looking shots of concerned
citizens welcoming grateful refugees into their homes. The
Head Peacekeeper says the president himself has ordered
part of his mansion readied to receive citizens tomorrow.
He adds that shopkeepers should also be prepared to lend
their floor space if requested.
"Tigris, that could be you," says Peeta. I realize he's
right. That even this narrow hallway of a shop could be
appropriated as the numbers swell. Then we'll be truly
trapped in the cellar, in constant danger of discovery. How
many days do we have? One? Maybe two?
The Head Peacekeeper comes back with more
instructions for the population. It seems that this evening
there was an unfortunate incident where a crowd beat to
death a young man who resembled Peeta. Henceforth, all
rebel sightings are to be reported immediately to
authorities, who will deal with the identification and arrest of
the suspect. They show a photo of the victim. Apart from
some obviously bleached curls, he looks about as much
like Peeta as I do.
"People have gone wild," Cressida murmurs.
We watch a brief rebel update in which we learn that
several more blocks have been taken today. I make note of
the intersections on my map and study it. "Line C is only
four blocks from here," I announce. Somehow that fills me
with more anxiety than the idea of Peacekeepers looking
for housing. I become very helpful. "Let me wash the
dishes."
"I'll give you a hand." Gale collects the plates.
I feel Peeta's eyes follow us out of the room. In the
cramped kitchen at the back of Tigris's shop, I fill the sink
with hot water and suds. "Do you think it's true?" I ask. "That
Snow will let refugees into the mansion?"
"I think he has to now, at least for the cameras," says
Gale."
I'm leaving in the morning," I say.
"I'm going with you," Gale says. "What should we do
with the others?"
"Pollux and Cressida could be useful. They're good
guides," I say. Pollux and Cressida aren't actually the
problem. "But Peeta's too..."
"Unpredictable," finishes Gale. "Do you think he'd still
let us leave him behind?"
"We can make the argument that he'll endanger us," I
say. "He might stay here, if we're convincing."
Peeta's fairly rational about our suggestion. He readily
agrees that his company could put the other four of us at
risk. I'm thinking this may all work out, that he can just sit out
the war in Tigris's cellar, when he announces he's going out
on his own.
"To do what?" asks Cressida.
"I'm not sure exactly. The one thing that I might still be
useful at is causing a diversion. You saw what happened to
that man who looked like me," he says.
"What if you...lose control?" I say.
"You mean...go mutt? Well, if I feel that coming on, I'll
try to get back here," he assures me.
"And if Snow gets you again?" asks Gale. "You don't
even have a gun."
"I'll just have to take my chances," says Peeta. "Like
the rest of you." The two exchange a long look, and then
Gale reaches into his breast pocket. He places his
nightlock tablet in Peeta's hand. Peeta lets it lie on his open
palm, neither rejecting nor accepting it. "What about you?"
"Don't worry. Beetee showed me how to detonate my
explosive arrows by hand. If that fails, I've got my knife. And
I'll have Katniss," says Gale with a smile. "She won't give
them the satisfaction of taking me alive."
The thought of Peacekeepers dragging Gale away
starts the tune playing in my head again....
Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
"Take it, Peeta," I say in a strained voice. I reach out
and close his fingers over the pill. "No one will be there to
help you."
We spend a fitful night, woken by one another's
nightmares, minds buzzing with the next day's plans. I'm
relieved when five o'clock rolls around and we can begin
whatever this day holds for us. We eat a mishmash of our
remaining food--canned peaches, crackers, and snails--
leaving one can of salmon for Tigris as meager thanks for
all she's done. The gesture seems to touch her in some
way. Her face contorts in an odd expression and she flies
into action. She spends the next hour remaking the five of
us. She redresses us so regular clothes hide our uniforms
before we even don our coats and cloaks. Covers our
military boots with some sort of furry slippers. Secures our
wigs with pins. Cleans off the garish remains of the paint
we so hastily applied to our faces and makes us up again.
Drapes our outerwear to conceal our weapons. Then gives
us handbags and bundles of knickknacks to carry. In the
end, we look exactly like the refugees fleeing the rebels.
"Never underestimate the power of a brilliant stylist,"
says Peeta. It's hard to tell, but I think Tigris might actually
blush under her stripes.
There are no helpful updates on the television, but the
alley seems as thick with refugees as the previous morning.
Our plan is to slip into the crowd in three groups. First
Cressida and Pollux, who will act as guides while keeping
a safe lead on us. Then Gale and myself, who intend to
position ourselves among the refugees assigned to the
mansion today. Then Peeta, who will trail behind us, ready
to create a disturbance as needed.
Tigris watches through the shutters for the right
moment, unbolts the door, and nods to Cressida and
Pollux. "Take care," Cressida says, and they are gone.
We'll be following in a minute. I get out the key, unlock
Peeta's cuffs, and stuff them in my pocket. He rubs his
wrists. Flexes them. I feel a kind of desperation rising up in
me. It's like I'm back in the Quarter Quell, with Beetee giving
Johanna and me that coil of wire.
"Listen," I say. "Don't do anything foolish."
"No. It's last-resort stuff. Completely," he says.
I wrap my arms around his neck, feel his arms hesitate
before they embrace me. Not as steady as they once were,
but still warm and strong. A thousand moments surge
through me. All the times these arms were my only refuge
from the world. Perhaps not fully appreciated then, but so
sweet in my memory, and now gone forever. "All right,
then." I release him.
"It's time," says Tigris. I kiss her cheek, fasten my red
hooded cloak, pull my scarf up over my nose, and follow
Gale out into the frigid air.
Sharp, icy snowflakes bite my exposed skin. The rising
sun's trying to break through the gloom without much
success. There's enough light to see the bundled forms
closest to you and little more. Perfect conditions, really,
except that I can't locate Cressida and Pollux. Gale and I
drop our heads and shuffle along with the refugees. I can
hear what I missed peeking through the shutters yesterday.
Crying, moaning, labored breathing. And, not too far away,
gunfire.
"Where are we going, Uncle?" a shivering little boy
asks a man weighed down with a small safe.
"To the president's mansion. They'll assign us a new
place to live," puffs the man.
We turn off the alley and spill out onto one of the main
avenues. "Stay to the right!" a voice orders, and I see the
Peacekeepers interspersed throughout the crowd,
directing the flow of human traffic. Scared faces peer out of
the plate-glass windows of the shops, which are already
becoming overrun with refugees. At this rate, Tigris may
have new houseguests by lunch. It was good for everybody
that we got out when we did.
It's brighter now, even with the snow picking up. I catch
sight of Cressida and Pollux about thirty yards ahead of us,
plodding along with the crowd. I crane my head around to
see if I can locate Peeta. I can't, but I've caught the eye of
an inquisitive-looking little girl in a lemon yellow coat. I
nudge Gale and slow my pace ever so slightly, to allow a
wall of people to form between us.
"We might need to split up," I say under my breath.
"There's a girl--"
Gunfire rips through the crowd, and several people
near me slump to the ground. Screams pierce the air as a
second round mows down another group behind us. Gale
and I drop to the street, scuttle the ten yards to the shops,
and take cover behind a display of spike-heeled boots
outside a shoe seller's.
A row of feathery footwear blocks Gale's view. "Who is
it? Can you see?" he asks me. What I can see, between
alternating pairs of lavender and mint green leather boots,
is a street full of bodies. The little girl who was watching me
kneels beside a motionless woman, screeching and trying
to rouse her. Another wave of bullets slices across the
chest of her yellow coat, staining it with red, knocking the
girl onto her back. For a moment, looking at her tiny
crumpled form, I lose my ability to form words. Gale prods
me with his elbow. "Katniss?"
"They're shooting from the roof above us," I tell Gale. I
watch a few more rounds, see the white uniforms dropping
into the snowy streets. "Trying to take out the
Peacekeepers, but they're not exactly crack shots. It must
be the rebels." I don't feel a rush of joy, although
theoretically my allies have broken through. I am transfixed
by that lemon yellow coat.
"If we start shooting, that's it," Gale says. "The whole
world will know it's us."
It's true. We're armed only with our fabulous bows. To
release an arrow would be like announcing to both sides
that we're here.
"No," I say forcefully. "We've got to get to Snow."
"Then we better start moving before the whole block
goes up," says Gale. Hugging the wall, we continue along
the street. Only the wall is mostly shopwindows. A pattern of
sweaty palms and gaping faces presses against the glass.
I yank my scarf up higher over my cheekbones as we dart
between outdoor displays. Behind a rack of framed photos
of Snow, we encounter a wounded Peacekeeper propped
against a strip of brick wall. He asks us for help. Gale
knees him in the side of the head and takes his gun. At the
intersection, he shoots a second Peacekeeper and we
both have firearms.
"So who are we supposed to be now?" I ask.
"Desperate citizens of the Capitol," says Gale. "The
Peacekeepers will think we're on their side, and hopefully
the rebels have more interesting targets."
I'm mulling over the wisdom of this latest role as we
sprint across the intersection, but by the time we reach the
next block, it no longer matters who we are. Who anyone is.
Because no one is looking at faces. The rebels are here, all
right. Pouring onto the avenue, taking cover in doorways,
behind vehicles, guns blazing, hoarse voices shouting
commands as they prepare to meet an army of
Peacekeepers marching toward us. Caught in the cross
fire are the refugees, unarmed, disoriented, many
wounded.
A pod's activated ahead of us, releasing a gush of
steam that parboils everyone in its path, leaving the victims
intestine-pink and very dead. After that, what little sense of
order there was unravels. As the remaining curlicues of
steam intertwine with the snow, visibility extends just to the
end of my barrel. Peacekeeper, rebel, citizen, who knows?
Everything that moves is a target. People shoot reflexively,
and I'm no exception. Heart pounding, adrenaline burning
through me, everyone is my enemy. Except Gale. My
hunting partner, the one person who has my back. There's
nothing to do but move forward, killing whoever comes into
our path. Screaming people, bleeding people, dead people
everywhere. As we reach the next corner, the entire block
ahead of us lights up with a rich purple glow. We
backpedal, hunker down in a stairwell, and squint into the
light. Something's happening to those illuminated by it.
They're assaulted by...what? A sound? A wave? A laser?
Weapons fall from their hands, fingers clutch their faces, as
blood sprays from all visible orifices--eyes, noses, mouths,
ears. In less than a minute, everyone's dead and the glow
vanishes. I grit my teeth and run, leaping over the bodies,
feet slipping in the gore. The wind whips the snow into
blinding swirls but doesn't block out the sound of another
wave of boots headed our way.
"Get down!" I hiss at Gale. We drop where we are. My
face lands in a still-warm pool of someone's blood, but I
play dead, remain motionless as the boots march over us.
Some avoid the bodies. Others grind into my hand, my
back, kick my head in passing. As the boots recede, I open
my eyes and nod to Gale.
On the next block, we encounter more terrified
refugees, but few soldiers. Just when it seems we might
have caught a break, there's a cracking sound, like an egg
hitting the side of a bowl but magnified a thousand times.
We stop, look around for the pod. There's nothing. Then I
feel the tips of my boots beginning to tilt ever so slightly.
"Run!" I cry to Gale. There's no time to explain, but in a few
seconds the nature of the pod becomes clear to everyone.
A seam has opened up down the center of the block. The
two sides of the tiled street are folding down like flaps,
slowly emptying the people into whatever lies beneath.
I'm torn between making a beeline for the next
intersection and trying to get to the doors that line the street
and break my way into a building. As a result, I end up
moving at a slight diagonal. As the flap continues to drop, I
find my feet scrambling, harder and harder, to find
purchase on the slippery tiles. It's like running along the
side of an icy hill that gets steeper at every step. Both of my
destinations--the intersection and the buildings--are a few
feet away when I feel the flap going. There's nothing to do
but use my last seconds of connection to the tiles to push
off for the intersection. As my hands latch on to the side, I
realize the flaps have swung straight down. My feet dangle
in the air, no foothold anywhere. From fifty feet below, a vile
stench hits my nose, like rotted corpses in the summer
heat. Black forms crawl around in the shadows, silencing
whoever survives the fall.
A strangled cry comes from my throat. No one is
coming to help me. I'm losing my grip on the icy ledge,
when I see I'm only about six feet from the corner of the pod.
I inch my hands along the ledge, trying to block out the
terrifying sounds from below. When my hands straddle the
corner, I swing my right boot up over the side. It catches on
something and I painstakingly drag myself up to street level.
Panting, trembling, I crawl out and wrap my arm around a
lamppost for an anchor, although the ground's perfectly flat.
"Gale?" I call into the abyss, heedless of being
recognized. "Gale?"
"Over here!" I look in bewilderment to my left. The flap
held up everything to the very base of the buildings. A
dozen or so people made it that far and now hang from
whatever provides a handhold. Doorknobs, knockers, mail
slots. Three doors down from me, Gale clings to the
decorative iron grating around an apartment door. He could
easily get inside if it was open. But despite repeated kicks
to the door, no one comes to his aid.
"Cover yourself!" I lift my gun. He turns away and I drill
the lock until the door flies inward. Gale swings into the
doorway, landing in a heap on the floor. For a moment, I
experience the elation of his rescue. Then the white-gloved
hands clamp down on him.
Gale meets my eyes, mouths something at me I can't
make out. I don't know what to do. I can't leave him, but I
can't reach him either. His lips move again. I shake my
head to indicate my confusion. At any minute, they'll realize
who they've captured. The Peacekeepers are hauling him
inside now. "Go!" I hear him yell.
I turn and run away from the pod. All alone now. Gale a
prisoner. Cressida and Pollux could be dead ten times
over. And Peeta? I haven't laid eyes on him since we left
Tigris's. I hold on to the idea that he may have gone back.
Felt an attack coming and retreated to the cellar while he
still had control. Realized there was no need for a diversion
when the Capitol has provided so many. No need to be bait
and have to take the nightlock--the nightlock! Gale doesn't
have any. And as for all that talk of detonating his arrows by
hand, he'll never get the chance. The first thing the
Peacekeepers will do is to strip him of his weapons.
I fall into a doorway, tears stinging my eyes. Shoot me.
That's what he was mouthing. I was supposed to shoot him!
That was my job. That was our unspoken promise, all of us,
to one another. And I didn't do it and now the Capitol will kill
him or torture him or hijack him or--the cracks begin
opening inside me, threatening to break me into pieces. I
have only one hope. That the Capitol falls, lays down its
arms, and gives up its prisoners before they hurt Gale. But I
can't see that happening while Snow's alive.
A pair of Peacekeepers runs by, barely glancing at the
whimpering Capitol girl huddled in a doorway. I choke down
my tears, wipe the existing ones off my face before they
can freeze, and pull myself back together. Okay, I'm still an
anonymous refugee. Or did the Peacekeepers who caught
Gale get a glimpse of me as I fled? I remove my cloak and
turn it inside out, letting the black lining show instead of the
red exterior. Arrange the hood so it conceals my face.
Grasping my gun close to my chest, I survey the block.
There's only a handful of dazed-looking stragglers. I trail
close behind a pair of old men who take no notice of me.
No one will expect me to be with old men. When we reach
the end of the next intersection, they stop and I almost
bump into them. It's the City Circle. Across the wide
expanse ringed by grand buildings sits the president's
mansion.
The Circle's full of people milling around, wailing, or
just sitting and letting the snow pile up around them. I fit
right in. I begin to weave my way across to the mansion,
tripping over abandoned treasures and snow-frosted limbs.
About halfway there, I become aware of the concrete
barricade. It's about four feet high and extends in a large
rectangle in front of the mansion. You would think it would
be empty, but it's packed with refugees. Maybe this is the
group that's been chosen to be sheltered at the mansion?
But as I draw closer, I notice something else. Everyone
inside the barricade is a child. Toddlers to teenagers.
Scared and frostbitten. Huddled in groups or rocking
numbly on the ground. They aren't being led into the
mansion. They're penned in, guarded on all sides by
Peacekeepers. I know immediately it's not for their
protection. If the Capitol wanted to safeguard them, they'd
be down in a bunker somewhere. This is for Snow's
protection. The children form his human shield.
There's a commotion and the crowd surges to the left.
I'm caught up by larger bodies, borne sideways, carried off
course. I hear shouts of "The rebels! The rebels!" and know
they must've broken through. The momentum slams me into
a flagpole and I cling to it. Using the rope that hangs from
the top, I pull myself up out of the crush of bodies. Yes, I can
see the rebel army pouring into the Circle, driving the
refugees back onto the avenues. I scan the area for the
pods that will surely be detonating. But that doesn't happen.
This is what happens:
A hovercraft marked with the Capitol's seal
materializes directly over the barricaded children. Scores
of silver parachutes rain down on them. Even in this chaos,
the children know what silver parachutes contain. Food.
Medicine. Gifts. They eagerly scoop them up, frozen fingers
struggling with the strings. The hovercraft vanishes, five
seconds pass, and then about twenty parachutes
simultaneously explode.
A wail rises from the crowd. The snow's red and
littered with undersized body parts. Many of the children die
immediately, but others lie in agony on the ground. Some
stagger around mutely, staring at the remaining silver
parachutes in their hands, as if they still might have
something precious inside. I can tell the Peacekeepers
didn't know this was coming by the way they are yanking
away the barricades, making a path to the children. Another
flock of white uniforms sweeps into the opening. But these
aren't Peacekeepers. They're medics. Rebel medics. I'd
know the uniforms anywhere. They swarm in among the
children, wielding medical kits.
First I get a glimpse of the blond braid down her back.
Then, as she yanks off her coat to cover a wailing child, I
notice the duck tail formed by her untucked shirt. I have the
same reaction I did the day Effie Trinket called her name at
the reaping. At least, I must go limp, because I find myself
at the base of the flagpole, unable to account for the last
few seconds. Then I am pushing through the crowd, just as I
did before. Trying to shout her name above the roar. I'm
almost there, almost to the barricade, when I think she
hears me. Because for just a moment, she catches sight of
me, her lips form my name.
And that's when the rest of the parachutes go off.
25
Real or not real? I am on fire. The balls of flame that
erupted from the parachutes shot over the barricades,
through the snowy air, and landed in the crowd. I was just
turning away when one caught me, ran its tongue up the
back of my body, and transformed me into something new.
A creature as unquenchable as the sun.
A fire mutt knows only a single sensation: agony. No
sight, no sound, no feeling except the unrelenting burning of
flesh. Perhaps there are periods of unconsciousness, but
what can it matter if I can't find refuge in them? I am Cinna's
bird, ignited, flying frantically to escape something
inescapable. The feathers of flame that grow from my body.
Beating my wings only fans the blaze. I consume myself, but
to no end.
Finally, my wings begin to falter, I lose height, and
gravity pulls me into a foamy sea the color of Finnick's
eyes. I float on my back, which continues to burn beneath
the water, but the agony quiets to pain. When I am adrift
and unable to navigate, that's when they come. The dead.
The ones I loved fly as birds in the open sky above me.
Soaring, weaving, calling to me to join them. I want so badly
to follow them, but the seawater saturates my wings,
making it impossible to lift them. The ones I hated have
taken to the water, horrible scaled things that tear my salty
flesh with needle teeth. Biting again and again. Dragging
me beneath the surface.
The small white bird tinged in pink dives down, buries
her claws in my chest, and tries to keep me afloat. "No,
Katniss! No! You can't go!"
But the ones I hated are winning, and if she clings to
me, she'll be lost as well. "Prim, let go!" And finally she
does.Deep in the water, I'm deserted by all. There's only the
sound of my breathing, the enormous effort it takes to draw
the water in, push it out of my lungs. I want to stop, I try to
hold my breath, but the sea forces its way in and out
against my will. "Let me die. Let me follow the others," I
beg whatever holds me here. There's no response.
Trapped for days, years, centuries maybe. Dead, but
not allowed to die. Alive, but as good as dead. So alone
that anyone, anything no matter how loathsome would be
welcome. But when I finally have a visitor, it's sweet.
Morphling. Coursing through my veins, easing the pain,
lightening my body so that it rises back toward the air and
rests again on the foam.
Foam. I really am floating on foam. I can feel it beneath
the tips of my fingers, cradling parts of my naked body.
There's much pain but there's also something like reality.
The sandpaper of my throat. The smell of burn medicine
from the first arena. The sound of my mother's voice. These
things frighten me, and I try to return to the deep to make
sense of them. But there's no going back. Gradually, I'm
forced to accept who I am. A badly burned girl with no
wings. With no fire. And no sister.
In the dazzling white Capitol hospital, the doctors work
their magic on me. Draping my rawness in new sheets of
skin. Coaxing the cells into thinking they are my own.
Manipulating my body parts, bending and stretching the
limbs to assure a good fit. I hear over and over again how
lucky I am. My eyes were spared. Most of my face was
spared. My lungs are responding to treatment. I will be as
good as new.
When my tender skin has toughened enough to
withstand the pressure of sheets, more visitors arrive. The
morphling opens the door to the dead and alive alike.
Haymitch, yellow and unsmiling. Cinna, stitching a new
wedding dress. Delly, prattling on about the niceness of
people. My father sings all four stanzas of "The Hanging
Tree" and reminds me that my mother--who sleeps in a
chair between shifts--isn't to know about it.
One day I awake to expectations and know I will not be
allowed to live in my dreamland. I must take food by mouth.
Move my own muscles. Make my way to the bathroom. A
brief appearance by President Coin clinches it.
"Don't worry," she says. "I've saved him for you."
The doctors' puzzlement grows over why I'm unable to
speak. Many tests are done, and while there's damage to
my vocal cords, it doesn't account for it. Finally, Dr.
Aurelius, a head doctor, comes up with the theory that I've
become a mental, rather than physical, Avox. That my
silence has been brought on by emotional trauma. Although
he's presented with a hundred proposed remedies, he tells
them to leave me alone. So I don't ask about anyone or
anything, but people bring me a steady stream of
information. On the war: The Capitol fell the day the
parachutes went off, President Coin leads Panem now, and
troops have been sent out to put down the small remaining
pockets of Capitol resistance. On President Snow: He's
being held prisoner, awaiting trial and most certain
execution. On my assassination team: Cressida and Pollux
have been sent out into the districts to cover the wreckage
of the war. Gale, who took two bullets in an escape attempt,
is mopping up Peacekeepers in 2. Peeta's still in the burn
unit. He made it to the City Circle after all. On my family: My
mother buries her grief in her work.
Having no work, grief buries me. All that keeps me
going is Coin's promise. That I can kill Snow. And when
that's done, nothing will be left.
Eventually, I'm released from the hospital and given a
room in the president's mansion to share with my mother.
She's almost never there, taking her meals and sleeping at
work. It falls to Haymitch to check on me, make sure I'm
eating and using my medicines. It's not an easy job. I take
to my old habits from District 13. Wandering unauthorized
through the mansion. Into bedrooms and offices, ballrooms
and baths. Seeking strange little hiding spaces. A closet of
furs. A cabinet in the library. A long-forgotten bathtub in a
room of discarded furniture. My places are dim and quiet
and impossible to find. I curl up, make myself smaller, try to
disappear entirely. Wrapped in silence, I slide my bracelet
that reads mentally disoriented around and around my
wrist.
My name is Katniss Everdeen. I am seventeen years
old. My home is District 12. There is no District 12. I am
the Mockingjay. I brought down the Capitol. President
Snow hates me. He killed my sister. Now I will kill him.
And then the Hunger Games will be over....
Periodically, I find myself back in my room, unsure
whether I was driven by a need for morphling or if Haymitch
ferreted me out. I eat the food, take the medicine, and am
required to bathe. It's not the water I mind, but the mirror
that reflects my naked fire-mutt body. The skin grafts still
retain a newborn-baby pinkness. The skin deemed
damaged but salvageable looks red, hot, and melted in
places. Patches of my former self gleam white and pale. I'm
like a bizarre patchwork quilt of skin. Parts of my hair were
singed off completely; the rest has been chopped off at odd
lengths. Katniss Everdeen, the girl who was on fire. I
wouldn't much care except the sight of my body brings back
the memory of the pain. And why I was in pain. And what
happened just before the pain started. And how I watched
my little sister become a human torch.
Closing my eyes doesn't help. Fire burns brighter in
the darkness.
Dr. Aurelius shows up sometimes. I like him because
he doesn't say stupid things like how I'm totally safe, or that
he knows I can't see it but I'll be happy again one day, or
even that things will be better in Panem now. He just asks if
I feel like talking, and when I don't answer, he falls asleep in
his chair. In fact, I think his visits are largely motivated by his
need for a nap. The arrangement works for both of us.
The time draws near, although I could not give you
exact hours and minutes. President Snow has been tried
and found guilty, sentenced to execution. Haymitch tells me,
I hear talk of it as I drift past the guards in the hallways. My
Mockingjay suit arrives in my room. Also my bow, looking
no worse for wear, but no sheath of arrows. Either because
they were damaged or more likely because I shouldn't have
weapons. I vaguely wonder if I should be preparing for the
event in some way, but nothing comes to mind.
Late one afternoon, after a long period in a cushioned
window seat behind a painted screen, I emerge and turn
left instead of right. I find myself in a strange part of the
mansion, and immediately lose my bearings. Unlike the
area where I'm quartered, there seems to be no one around
to ask. I like it, though. Wish I'd found it sooner. It's so quiet,
with the thick carpets and heavy tapestries soaking up the
sound. Softly lit. Muted colors. Peaceful. Until I smell the
roses. I dive behind some curtains, shaking too hard to run,
while I await the mutts. Finally, I realize there are no mutts
coming. So, what do I smell? Real roses? Could it be that I
am near the garden where the evil things grow?
As I creep down the hall, the odor becomes
overpowering. Perhaps not as strong as the actual mutts,
but purer, because it's not competing with sewage and
explosives. I turn a corner and find myself staring at two
surprised guards. Not Peacekeepers, of course. There are
no more Peacekeepers. But not the trim, gray-uniformed
soldiers from 13 either. These two, a man and a woman,
wear the tattered, thrown-together clothes of actual rebels.
Still bandaged and gaunt, they are now keeping watch over
the doorway to the roses. When I move to enter, their guns
form an X in front of me.
"You can't go in, miss," says the man.
"Soldier," the woman corrects him. "You can't go in,
Soldier Everdeen. President's orders."
I just stand there patiently waiting for them to lower
their guns, for them to understand, without my telling them,
that behind those doors is something I need. Just a rose. A
single bloom. To place in Snow's lapel before I shoot him.
My presence seems to worry the guards. They're
discussing calling Haymitch, when a woman speaks up
behind me. "Let her go in."
I know the voice but can't immediately place it. Not
Seam, not 13, definitely not Capitol. I turn my head and find
myself face-to-face with Paylor, the commander from 8.
She looks even more beat up than she did at the hospital,
but who doesn't?
"On my authority," says Paylor. "She has a right to
anything behind that door." These are her soldiers, not
Coin's. They drop their weapons without question and let
me pass.
At the end of a short hallway, I push apart the glass
doors and step inside. By now the smell's so strong that it
begins to flatten out, as if there's no more my nose can
absorb. The damp, mild air feels good on my hot skin. And
the roses are glorious. Row after row of sumptuous blooms,
in lush pink, sunset orange, and even pale blue. I wander
through the aisles of carefully pruned plants, looking but not
touching, because I have learned the hard way how deadly
these beauties can be. I know when I find it, crowning the
top of a slender bush. A magnificent white bud just
beginning to open. I pull my left sleeve over my hand so that
my skin won't actually have to touch it, take up a pair of
pruning shears, and have just positioned them on the stem
when he speaks.
"That's a nice one."
My hand jerks, the shears snap shut, severing the
stem.
"The colors are lovely, of course, but nothing says
perfection like white."
I still can't see him, but his voice seems to rise up from
an adjacent bed of red roses. Delicately pinching the stem
of the bud through the fabric of my sleeve, I move slowly
around the corner and find him sitting on a stool against the
wall. He's as well groomed and finely dressed as ever, but
weighted down with manacles, ankle shackles, tracking
devices. In the bright light, his skin's a pale, sickly green.
He holds a white handkerchief spotted with fresh blood.
Even in his deteriorated state, his snake eyes shine bright
and cold. "I was hoping you'd find your way to my quarters."
His quarters. I have trespassed into his home, the way
he slithered into mine last year, hissing threats with his
bloody, rosy breath. This greenhouse is one of his rooms,
perhaps his favorite; perhaps in better times he tended the
plants himself. But now it's part of his prison. That's why the
guards halted me. And that's why Paylor let me in.
I'd supposed he would be secured in the deepest
dungeon that the Capitol had to offer, not cradled in the lap
of luxury. Yet Coin left him here. To set a precedent, I
guess. So that if in the future she ever fell from grace, it
would be understood that presidents--even the most
despicable--get special treatment. Who knows, after all,
when her own power might fade?
"There are so many things we should discuss, but I
have a feeling your visit will be brief. So, first things first."
He begins to cough, and when he removes the
handkerchief from his mouth, it's redder. "I wanted to tell
you how very sorry I am about your sister."
Even in my deadened, drugged condition, this sends a
stab of pain through me. Reminding me that there are no
limits to his cruelty. And how he will go to his grave trying to
destroy me.
"So wasteful, so unnecessary. Anyone could see the
game was over by that point. In fact, I was just about to
issue an official surrender when they released those
parachutes." His eyes are glued on me, unblinking, so as
not to miss a second of my reaction. But what he's said
makes no sense. When they released the parachutes?
"Well, you really didn't think I gave the order, did you?
Forget the obvious fact that if I'd had a working hovercraft at
my disposal, I'd have been using it to make an escape. But
that aside, what purpose could it have served? We both
know I'm not above killing children, but I'm not wasteful. I
take life for very specific reasons. And there was no reason
for me to destroy a pen full of Capitol children. None at all."
I wonder if the next fit of coughing is staged so that I
can have time to absorb his words. He's lying. Of course,
he's lying. But there's something struggling to free itself
from the lie as well.
"However, I must concede it was a masterful move on
Coin's part. The idea that I was bombing our own helpless
children instantly snapped whatever frail allegiance my
people still felt to me. There was no real resistance after
that. Did you know it aired live? You can see Plutarch's
hand there. And in the parachutes. Well, it's that sort of
thinking that you look for in a Head Gamemaker, isn't it?"
Snow dabs the corners of his mouth. "I'm sure he wasn't
gunning for your sister, but these things happen."
I'm not with Snow now. I'm in Special Weaponry back
in 13 with Gale and Beetee. Looking at the designs based
on Gale's traps. That played on human sympathies. The
first bomb killed the victims. The second, the rescuers.
Remembering Gale's words.
"Beetee and I have been following the same rule
book President Snow used when he hijacked Peeta."
"My failure," says Snow, "was being so slow to grasp
Coin's plan. To let the Capitol and districts destroy one
another, and then step in to take power with Thirteen barely
scratched. Make no mistake, she was intending to take my
place right from the beginning. I shouldn't be surprised.
After all, it was Thirteen that started the rebellion that led to
the Dark Days, and then abandoned the rest of the districts
when the tide turned against it. But I wasn't watching Coin. I
was watching you, Mockingjay. And you were watching me.
I'm afraid we have both been played for fools."
I refuse for this to be true. Some things even I can't
survive. I utter my first words since my sister's death. "I don't
believe you."
Snow shakes his head in mock disappointment. "Oh,
my dear Miss Everdeen. I thought we had agreed not to lie
to each other."
26
Out in the hall, I find Paylor standing in exactly the
same spot. "Did you find what you were looking for?" she
asks.
I hold up the white bud in answer and then stumble
past her. I must have made it back to my room, because
the next thing I know, I'm filling a glass with water from the
bathroom faucet and sticking the rose in it. I sink to my
knees on the cold tile and squint at the flower, as the
whiteness seems hard to focus on in the stark fluorescent
light. My finger catches the inside of my bracelet, twisting it
like a tourniquet, hurting my wrist. I'm hoping the pain will
help me hang on to reality the way it did for Peeta. I must
hang on. I must know the truth about what has happened.
There are two possibilities, although the details
associated with them may vary. First, as I've believed, that
the Capitol sent in that hovercraft, dropped the parachutes,
and sacrificed its children's lives, knowing the recently
arrived rebels would go to their aid. There's evidence to
support this. The Capitol's seal on the hovercraft, the lack of
any attempt to blow the enemy out of the sky, and their long
history of using children as pawns in their battle against the
districts. Then there's Snow's account. That a Capitol
hovercraft manned by rebels bombed the children to bring
a speedy end to the war. But if this was the case, why didn't
the Capitol fire on the enemy? Did the element of surprise
throw them? Had they no defenses left? Children are
precious to 13, or so it has always seemed. Well, not me,
maybe. Once I had outlived my usefulness, I was
expendable. Although I think it's been a long time since I've
been considered a child in this war. And why would they do
it knowing their own medics would likely respond and be
taken out by the second blast? They wouldn't. They couldn't.
Snow's lying. Manipulating me as he always has. Hoping to
turn me against the rebels and possibly destroy them. Yes.
Of course.
Then what's nagging at me? Those double-exploding
bombs, for one. It's not that the Capitol couldn't have the
same weapon, it's just that I'm sure the rebels did. Gale and
Beetee's brainchild. Then there's the fact that Snow made
no escape attempt, when I know him to be the consummate
survivor. It seems hard to believe he didn't have a retreat
somewhere, some bunker stocked with provisions where
he could live out the rest of his snaky little life. And finally,
there's his assessment of Coin. What's irrefutable is that
she's done exactly what he said. Let the Capitol and the
districts run one another into the ground and then sauntered
in to take power. Even if that was her plan, it doesn't mean
she dropped those parachutes. Victory was already in her
grasp. Everything was in her grasp.
Except me.
I recall Boggs's response when I admitted I hadn't put
much thought into Snow's successor. "If your immediate
answer isn't Coin, then you're a threat. You're the face of
the rebellion. You may have more influence than any
other single person. Outwardly, the most you've ever done
is tolerated her."
Suddenly, I'm thinking of Prim, who was not yet
fourteen, not yet old enough to be granted the title of
soldier, but somehow working on the front lines. How did
such a thing happen? That my sister would have wanted to
be there, I have no doubt. That she would be more capable
than many older than she is a given. But for all that,
someone very high up would have had to approve putting a
thirteen-year-old in combat. Did Coin do it, hoping that
losing Prim would push me completely over the edge? Or,
at least, firmly on her side? I wouldn't even have had to
witness it in person. Numerous cameras would be covering
the City Circle. Capturing the moment forever.
No, now I am going crazy, slipping into some state of
paranoia. Too many people would know of the mission.
Word would get out. Or would it? Who would have to know
besides Coin, Plutarch, and a small, loyal or easily
disposable crew?
I badly need help working this out, only everyone I trust
is dead. Cinna. Boggs. Finnick. Prim. There's Peeta, but
he couldn't do any more than speculate, and who knows
what state his mind's in, anyway. And that leaves only Gale.
He's far away, but even if he were beside me, could I
confide in him? What could I say, how could I phrase it,
without implying that it was his bomb that killed Prim? The
impossibility of that idea, more than any, is why Snow must
be lying.
Ultimately, there's only one person to turn to who might
know what happened and might still be on my side. To
broach the subject at all will be a risk. But while I think
Haymitch might gamble with my life in the arena, I don't
think he'd rat me out to Coin. Whatever problems we may
have with each other, we prefer resolving our differences
one-on-one.
I scramble off the tiles, out the door, and across the hall
to his room. When there's no response to my knock, I push
inside. Ugh. It's amazing how quickly he can defile a space.
Half-eaten plates of food, shattered liquor bottles, and
pieces of broken furniture from a drunken rampage scatter
his quarters. He lies, unkempt and unwashed, in a tangle of
sheets on the bed, passed out.
"Haymitch," I say, shaking his leg. Of course, that's
insufficient. But I give it a few more tries before I dump the
pitcher of water in his face. He comes to with a gasp,
slashing blindly with his knife. Apparently, the end of Snow's
reign didn't equal the end of his terror.
"Oh. You," he says. I can tell by his voice that he's still
loaded.
"Haymitch," I begin.
"Listen to that. The Mockingjay found her voice." He
laughs. "Well, Plutarch's going to be happy." He takes a
swig from a bottle. "Why am I soaking wet?" I lamely drop
the pitcher behind me into a pile of dirty clothes.
"I need your help," I say.
Haymitch belches, filling the air with white liquor fumes.
"What is it, sweetheart? More boy trouble?" I don't know
why, but this hurts me in a way Haymitch rarely can. It must
show on my face, because even in his drunken state, he
tries to take it back. "Okay, not funny." I'm already at the
door. "Not funny! Come back!" By the thud of his body
hitting the floor, I assume he tried to follow me, but there's
no point.
I zigzag through the mansion and disappear into a
wardrobe full of silken things. I yank them from hangers until
I have a pile and then burrow into it. In the lining of my
pocket, I find a stray morphling tablet and swallow it dry,
heading off my rising hysteria. It's not enough to right things,
though. I hear Haymitch calling me in the distance, but he
won't find me in his condition. Especially not in this new
spot. Swathed in silk, I feel like a caterpillar in a cocoon
awaiting metamorphosis. I always supposed that to be a
peaceful condition. At first it is. But as I journey into night, I
feel more and more trapped, suffocated by the slippery
bindings, unable to emerge until I have transformed into
something of beauty. I squirm, trying to shed my ruined
body and unlock the secret to growing flawless wings.
Despite enormous effort, I remain a hideous creature, fired
into my current form by the blast from the bombs.
The encounter with Snow opens the door to my old
repertoire of nightmares. It's like being stung by tracker
jackers again. A wave of horrifying images with a brief
respite I confuse with waking--only to find another wave
knocking me back. When the guards finally locate me, I'm
sitting on the floor of the wardrobe, tangled in silk,
screaming my head off. I fight them at first, until they
convince me they're trying to help, peel away the choking
garments, and escort me back to my room. On the way, we
pass a window and I see a gray, snowy dawn spreading
across the Capitol.
A very hungover Haymitch waits with a handful of pills
and a tray of food that neither of us has the stomach for. He
makes a feeble attempt to get me to talk again but, seeing
it's pointless, sends me to a bath someone has drawn. The
tub's deep, with three steps to the bottom. I ease down into
the warm water and sit, up to my neck in suds, hoping the
medicines kick in soon. My eyes focus on the rose that has
spread its petals overnight, filling the steamy air with its
strong perfume. I rise and reach for a towel to smother it,
when there's a tentative knock and the bathroom door
opens, revealing three familiar faces. They try to smile at
me, but even Venia can't conceal her shock at my ravaged
mutt body. "Surprise!" Octavia squeaks, and then bursts
into tears. I'm puzzling over their reappearance when I
realize that this must be it, the day of the execution. They've
come to prep me for the cameras. Remake me to Beauty
Base Zero. No wonder Octavia's crying. It's an impossible
task.
They can barely touch my patchwork of skin for fear of
hurting me, so I rinse and dry off myself. I tell them I hardly
notice the pain anymore, but Flavius still winces as he
drapes a robe around me. In the bedroom, I find another
surprise. Sitting upright in a chair. Polished from her
metallic gold wig to her patent leather high heels, gripping a
clipboard. Remarkably unchanged except for the vacant
look in her eyes.
"Effie," I say.
"Hello, Katniss." She stands and kisses me on the
cheek as if nothing has occurred since our last meeting, the
night before the Quarter Quell. "Well, it looks like we've got
another big, big, big day ahead of us. So why don't you
start your prep and I'll just pop over and check on the
arrangements."
"Okay," I say to her back.
"They say Plutarch and Haymitch had a hard time
keeping her alive," comments Venia under her breath. "She
was imprisoned after your escape, so that helps."
It's quite a stretch. Effie Trinket, rebel. But I don't want
Coin killing her, so I make a mental note to present her that
way if asked. "I guess it's good Plutarch kidnapped you
three after all."
"We're the only prep team still alive. And all the stylists
from the Quarter Quell are dead," says Venia. She doesn't
say who specifically killed them. I'm beginning to wonder if
it matters. She gingerly takes one of my scarred hands and
holds it out for inspection. "Now, what do you think for the
nails? Red or maybe a jet black?"
Flavius performs some beauty miracle on my hair,
managing to even out the front while getting some of the
longer locks to hide the bald spots in the back. My face,
since it was spared from the flames, presents no more than
the usual challenges. Once I'm in Cinna's Mockingjay suit,
the only scars visible are on my neck, forearms, and hands.
Octavia secures my Mockingjay pin over my heart and we
step back to look in the mirror. I can't believe how normal
they've made me look on the outside when inwardly I'm
such a wasteland.
There's a tap at the door and Gale steps in. "Can I
have a minute?" he asks. In the mirror, I watch my prep
team. Unsure of where to go, they bump into one another a
few times and then closet themselves in the bathroom. Gale
comes up behind me and we examine each other's
reflection. I'm searching for something to hang on to, some
sign of the girl and boy who met by chance in the woods
five years ago and became inseparable. I'm wondering
what would have happened to them if the Hunger Games
had not reaped the girl. If she would have fallen in love with
the boy, married him even. And sometime in the future,
when the brothers and sisters had been raised up,
escaped with him into the woods and left 12 behind forever.
Would they have been happy, out in the wild, or would the
dark, twisted sadness between them have grown up even
without the Capitol's help?
"I brought you this." Gale holds up a sheath. When I
take it, I notice it holds a single, ordinary arrow. "It's
supposed to be symbolic. You firing the last shot of the
war."
"What if I miss?" I say. "Does Coin retrieve it and bring
it back to me? Or just shoot Snow through the head
herself?"
"You won't miss." Gale adjusts the sheath on my
shoulder.
We stand there, face-to-face, not meeting each other's
eyes. "You didn't come see me in the hospital." He doesn't
answer, so finally I just say it. "Was it your bomb?"
"I don't know. Neither does Beetee," he says. "Does it
matter? You'll always be thinking about it."
He waits for me to deny it; I want to deny it, but it's true.
Even now I can see the flash that ignites her, feel the heat of
the flames. And I will never be able to separate that
moment from Gale. My silence is my answer.
"That was the one thing I had going for me. Taking
care of your family," he says. "Shoot straight, okay?" He
touches my cheek and leaves. I want to call him back and
tell him that I was wrong. That I'll figure out a way to make
peace with this. To remember the circumstances under
which he created the bomb. Take into account my own
inexcusable crimes. Dig up the truth about who dropped the
parachutes. Prove it wasn't the rebels. Forgive him. But
since I can't, I'll just have to deal with the pain.
Effie comes in to usher me to some kind of meeting. I
collect my bow and at the last minute remember the rose,
glistening in its glass of water. When I open the door to the
bathroom, I find my prep team sitting in a row on the edge
of the tub, hunched and defeated. I remember I'm not the
only one whose world has been stripped away. "Come on,"
I tell them. "We've got an audience waiting."
I'm expecting a production meeting in which Plutarch
instructs me where to stand and gives me my cue for
shooting Snow. Instead, I find myself sent into a room
where six people sit around a table. Peeta, Johanna,
Beetee, Haymitch, Annie, and Enobaria. They all wear the
gray rebel uniforms from 13. No one looks particularly well.
"What's this?" I say.
"We're not sure," Haymitch answers. "It appears to be
a gathering of the remaining victors."
"We're all that's left?" I ask.
"The price of celebrity," says Beetee. "We were
targeted from both sides. The Capitol killed the victors they
suspected of being rebels. The rebels killed those thought
to be allied with the Capitol."
Johanna scowls at Enobaria. "So what's she doing
here?"
"She is protected under what we call the Mockingjay
Deal," says Coin as she enters behind me. "Wherein
Katniss Everdeen agreed to support the rebels in
exchange for captured victors' immunity. Katniss has
upheld her side of the bargain, and so shall we."
Enobaria smiles at Johanna. "Don't look so smug,"
says Johanna. "We'll kill you anyway."
"Sit down, please, Katniss," says Coin, closing the
door. I take a seat between Annie and Beetee, carefully
placing Snow's rose on the table. As usual, Coin gets right
to the point. "I've asked you here to settle a debate. Today
we will execute Snow. In the previous weeks, hundreds of
his accomplices in the oppression of Panem have been
tried and now await their own deaths. However, the
suffering in the districts has been so extreme that these
measures appear insufficient to the victims. In fact, many
are calling for a complete annihilation of those who held
Capitol citizenship. However, in the interest of maintaining
a sustainable population, we cannot afford this."
Through the water in the glass, I see a distorted image
of one of Peeta's hands. The burn marks. We are both fire
mutts now. My eyes travel up to where the flames licked
across his forehead, singeing away his brows but just
missing his eyes. Those same blue eyes that used to meet
mine and then flit away at school. Just as they do now.
"So, an alternative has been placed on the table.
Since my colleagues and I can come to no consensus, it
has been agreed that we will let the victors decide. A
majority of four will approve the plan. No one may abstain
from the vote," says Coin. "What has been proposed is that
in lieu of eliminating the entire Capitol population, we have
a final, symbolic Hunger Games, using the children directly
related to those who held the most power."
All seven of us turn to her. "What?" says Johanna.
"We hold another Hunger Games using Capitol
children," says Coin.
"Are you joking?" asks Peeta.
"No. I should also tell you that if we do hold the Games,
it will be known it was done with your approval, although the
individual breakdown of your votes will be kept secret for
your own security," Coin tells us.
"Was this Plutarch's idea?" asks Haymitch.
"It was mine," says Coin. "It seemed to balance the
need for vengeance with the least loss of life. You may cast
your votes."
"No!" bursts out Peeta. "I vote no, of course! We can't
have another Hunger Games!"
"Why not?" Johanna retorts. "It seems very fair to me.
Snow even has a granddaughter. I vote yes."
"So do I," says Enobaria, almost indifferently. "Let
them have a taste of their own medicine."
"This is why we rebelled! Remember?" Peeta looks at
the rest of us. "Annie?"
"I vote no with Peeta," she says. "So would Finnick if
he were here."
"But he isn't, because Snow's mutts killed him,"
Johanna reminds her.
"No," says Beetee. "It would set a bad precedent. We
have to stop viewing one another as enemies. At this point,
unity is essential for our survival. No."
"We're down to Katniss and Haymitch," says Coin.
Was it like this then? Seventy-five years or so ago?
Did a group of people sit around and cast their votes on
initiating the Hunger Games? Was there dissent? Did
someone make a case for mercy that was beaten down by
the calls for the deaths of the districts' children? The scent
of Snow's rose curls up into my nose, down into my throat,
squeezing it tight with despair. All those people I loved,
dead, and we are discussing the next Hunger Games in an
attempt to avoid wasting life. Nothing has changed. Nothing
will ever change now.
I weigh my options carefully, think everything through.
Keeping my eyes on the rose, I say, "I vote yes...for Prim."
"Haymitch, it's up to you," says Coin.
A furious Peeta hammers Haymitch with the atrocity he
could become party to, but I can feel Haymitch watching
me. This is the moment, then. When we find out exactly just
how alike we are, and how much he truly understands me.
"I'm with the Mockingjay," he says.
"Excellent. That carries the vote," says Coin. "Now we
really must take our places for the execution."
As she passes me, I hold up the glass with the rose.
"Can you see that Snow's wearing this? Just over his
heart?"
Coin smiles. "Of course. And I'll make sure he knows
about the Games."
"Thank you," I say.
People sweep into the room, surround me. The last
touch of powder, the instructions from Plutarch as I'm
guided to the front doors of the mansion. The City Circle
runs over, spills people down the side streets. The others
take their places outside. Guards. Officials. Rebel leaders.
Victors. I hear the cheers that indicate Coin has appeared
on the balcony. Then Effie taps my shoulder, and I step out
into the cold winter sunlight. Walk to my position,
accompanied by the deafening roar of the crowd. As
directed, I turn so they see me in profile, and wait. When
they march Snow out the door, the audience goes insane.
They secure his hands behind a post, which is
unnecessary. He's not going anywhere. There's nowhere to
go. This is not the roomy stage before the Training Center
but the narrow terrace in front of the president's mansion.
No wonder no one bothered to have me practice. He's ten
yards away.
I feel the bow purring in my hand. Reach back and
grasp the arrow. Position it, aim at the rose, but watch his
face. He coughs and a bloody dribble runs down his chin.
His tongue flicks over his puffy lips. I search his eyes for the
slightest sign of anything, fear, remorse, anger. But there's
only the same look of amusement that ended our last
conversation. It's as if he's speaking the words again. "Oh,
my dear Miss Everdeen. I thought we had agreed not to
lie to each other."
He's right. We did.
The point of my arrow shifts upward. I release the
string. And President Coin collapses over the side of the
balcony and plunges to the ground. Dead.
27
In the stunned reaction that follows, I'm aware of one
sound. Snow's laughter. An awful gurgling cackle
accompanied by an eruption of foamy blood when the
coughing begins. I see him bend forward, spewing out his
life, until the guards block him from my sight.
As the gray uniforms begin to converge on me, I think
of what my brief future as the assassin of Panem's new
president holds. The interrogation, probable torture, certain
public execution. Having, yet again, to say my final
goodbyes to the handful of people who still maintain a hold
on my heart. The prospect of facing my mother, who will
now be entirely alone in the world, decides it.
"Good night," I whisper to the bow in my hand and feel
it go still. I raise my left arm and twist my neck down to rip
off the pill on my sleeve. Instead my teeth sink into flesh. I
yank my head back in confusion to find myself looking into
Peeta's eyes, only now they hold my gaze. Blood runs from
the teeth marks on the hand he clamped over my nightlock.
"Let me go!" I snarl at him, trying to wrest my arm from his
grasp.
"I can't," he says. As they pull me away from him, I feel
the pocket ripped from my sleeve, see the deep violet pill
fall to the ground, watch Cinna's last gift get crunched under
a guard's boot. I transform into a wild animal, kicking,
clawing, biting, doing whatever I can to free myself from this
web of hands as the crowd pushes in. The guards lift me up
above the fray, where I continue to thrash as I'm conveyed
over the crush of people. I start screaming for Gale. I can't
find him in the throng, but he will know what I want. A good
clean shot to end it all. Only there's no arrow, no bullet. Is it
possible he can't see me? No. Above us, on the giant
screens placed around the City Circle, everyone can watch
the whole thing being played out. He sees, he knows, but
he doesn't follow through. Just as I didn't when he was
captured. Sorry excuses for hunters and friends. Both of us.
I'm on my own.
In the mansion, they handcuff and blindfold me. I'm half
dragged, half carried down long passages, up and down
elevators, and deposited on a carpeted floor. The cuffs are
removed and a door slams closed behind me. When I push
the blindfold up, I find I'm in my old room at the Training
Center. The one where I lived during those last precious
days before my first Hunger Games and the Quarter Quell.
The bed's stripped to the mattress, the closet gapes open,
showing the emptiness inside, but I'd know this room
anywhere.
It's a struggle to get to my feet and peel off my
Mockingjay suit. I'm badly bruised and might have a broken
finger or two, but it's my skin that's paid most dearly for my
struggle with the guards. The new pink stuff has shredded
like tissue paper and blood seeps through the laboratorygrown
cells. No medics show up, though, and as I'm too far
gone to care, I crawl up onto the mattress, expecting to
bleed to death.
No such luck. By evening, the blood clots, leaving me
stiff and sore and sticky but alive. I limp into the shower and
program in the gentlest cycle I can remember, free of any
soaps and hair products, and squat under the warm spray,
elbows on my knees, head in my hands.
My name is Katniss Everdeen. Why am I not dead? I
should be dead. It would be best for everyone if I were
dead....
When I step out on the mat, the hot air bakes my
damaged skin dry. There's nothing clean to put on. Not
even a towel to wrap around me. Back in the room, I find
the Mockingjay suit has disappeared. In its place is a paper
robe. A meal has been sent up from the mysterious kitchen
with a container of my medications for dessert. I go ahead
and eat the food, take the pills, rub the salve on my skin. I
need to focus now on the manner of my suicide.
I curl back up on the bloodstained mattress, not cold
but feeling so naked with just the paper to cover my tender
flesh. Jumping to my death's not an option--the window
glass must be a foot thick. I can make an excellent noose,
but there's nothing to hang myself from. It's possible I could
hoard my pills and then knock myself off with a lethal dose,
except that I'm sure I'm being watched round the clock. For
all I know, I'm on live television at this very moment while
commentators try to analyze what could possibly have
motivated me to kill Coin. The surveillance makes almost
any suicide attempt impossible. Taking my life is the
Capitol's privilege. Again.
What I can do is give up. I resolve to lie on the bed
without eating, drinking, or taking my medications. I could
do it, too. Just die. If it weren't for the morphling withdrawal.
Not bit by bit like in the hospital in 13, but cold turkey. I must
have been on a fairly large dose because when the craving
for it hits, accompanied by tremors, and shooting pains,
and unbearable cold, my resolve's crushed like an eggshell.
I'm on my knees, raking the carpet with my fingernails to
find those precious pills I flung away in a stronger moment. I
revise my suicide plan to slow death by morphling. I will
become a yellow-skinned bag of bones, with enormous
eyes. I'm a couple of days into the plan, making good
progress, when something unexpected happens.
I begin to sing. At the window, in the shower, in my
sleep. Hour after hour of ballads, love songs, mountain airs.
All the songs my father taught me before he died, for
certainly there has been very little music in my life since.
What's amazing is how clearly I remember them. The tunes,
the lyrics. My voice, at first rough and breaking on the high
notes, warms up into something splendid. A voice that
would make the mockingjays fall silent and then tumble over
themselves to join in. Days pass, weeks. I watch the snows
fall on the ledge outside my window. And in all that time,
mine is the only voice I hear.
What are they doing, anyway? What's the holdup out
there? How difficult can it be to arrange the execution of
one murderous girl? I continue with my own annihilation. My
body's thinner than it's ever been and my battle against
hunger is so fierce that sometimes the animal part of me
gives in to the temptation of buttered bread or roasted
meat. But still, I'm winning. For a few days I feel quite unwell
and think I may finally be traveling out of this life, when I
realize my morphling tablets are shrinking. They are trying
to slowly wean me off the stuff. But why? Surely a drugged
Mockingjay will be easier to dispose of in front of a crowd.
And then a terrible thought hits me: What if they're not going
to kill me? What if they have more plans for me? A new way
to remake, train, and use me?
I won't do it. If I can't kill myself in this room, I will take
the first opportunity outside of it to finish the job. They can
fatten me up. They can give me a full body polish, dress me
up, and make me beautiful again. They can design dream
weapons that come to life in my hands, but they will never
again brainwash me into the necessity of using them. I no
longer feel any allegiance to these monsters called human
beings, despise being one myself. I think that Peeta was
onto something about us destroying one another and letting
some decent species take over. Because something is
significantly wrong with a creature that sacrifices its
children's lives to settle its differences. You can spin it any
way you like. Snow thought the Hunger Games were an
efficient means of control. Coin thought the parachutes
would expedite the war. But in the end, who does it benefit?
No one. The truth is, it benefits no one to live in a world
where these things happen.
After two days of my lying on my mattress with no
attempt to eat, drink, or even take a morphling tablet, the
door to my room opens. Someone crosses around the bed
into my field of vision. Haymitch. "Your trial's over," he says.
"Come on. We're going home."
Home? What's he talking about? My home's gone.
And even if it were possible to go to this imaginary place, I
am too weak to move. Strangers appear. Rehydrate and
feed me. Bathe and clothe me. One lifts me like a rag doll
and carries me up to the roof, onto a hovercraft, and
fastens me into a seat. Haymitch and Plutarch sit across
from me. In a few moments, we're airborne.
I've never seen Plutarch in such a good mood. He's
positively glowing. "You must have a million questions!"
When I don't respond, he answers them anyway.
After I shot Coin, there was pandemonium. When the
ruckus died down, they discovered Snow's body, still
tethered to the post. Opinions differ on whether he choked
to death while laughing or was crushed by the crowd. No
one really cares. An emergency election was thrown
together and Paylor was voted in as president. Plutarch
was appointed secretary of communications, which means
he sets the programming for the airwaves. The first big
televised event was my trial, in which he was also a star
witness. In my defense, of course. Although most of the
credit for my exoneration must be given to Dr. Aurelius, who
apparently earned his naps by presenting me as a
hopeless, shell-shocked lunatic. One condition for my
release is that I'll continue under his care, although it will
have to be by phone because he'd never live in a forsaken
place like 12, and I'm confined there until further notice. The
truth is, no one quite knows what to do with me now that the
war's over, although if another one should spring up,
Plutarch's sure they could find a role for me. Then Plutarch
has a good laugh. It never seems to bother him when no
one else appreciates his jokes.
"Are you preparing for another war, Plutarch?" I ask.
"Oh, not now. Now we're in that sweet period where
everyone agrees that our recent horrors should never be
repeated," he says. "But collective thinking is usually shortlived.
We're fickle, stupid beings with poor memories and a
great gift for self-destruction. Although who knows? Maybe
this will be it, Katniss."
"What?" I ask.
"The time it sticks. Maybe we are witnessing the
evolution of the human race. Think about that." And then he
asks me if I'd like to perform on a new singing program he's
launching in a few weeks. Something upbeat would be
good. He'll send the crew to my house.
We land briefly in District 3 to drop off Plutarch. He's
meeting with Beetee to update the technology on the
broadcast system. His parting words to me are "Don't be a
stranger."
When we're back among the clouds, I look at
Haymitch. "So why are you going back to Twelve?"
"They can't seem to find a place for me in the Capitol
either," he says.
At first, I don't question this. But doubts begin to creep
in. Haymitch hasn't assassinated anyone. He could go
anywhere. If he's coming back to 12, it's because he's been
ordered to. "You have to look after me, don't you? As my
mentor?" He shrugs. Then I realize what it means. "My
mother's not coming back."
"No," he says. He pulls an envelope from his jacket
pocket and hands it to me. I examine the delicate, perfectly
formed writing. "She's helping to start up a hospital in
District Four. She wants you to call as soon as we get in."
My finger traces the graceful swoop of the letters. "You
know why she can't come back." Yes, I know why. Because
between my father and Prim and the ashes, the place is too
painful to bear. But apparently not for me. "Do you want to
know who else won't be there?"
"No," I say. "I want to be surprised."
Like a good mentor, Haymitch makes me eat a
sandwich and then pretends he believes I'm asleep for the
rest of the trip. He busies himself going through every
compartment on the hovercraft, finding the liquor, and
stowing it in his bag. It's night when we land on the green of
the Victor's Village. Half of the houses have lights in the
windows, including Haymitch's and mine. Not Peeta's.
Someone has built a fire in my kitchen. I sit in the rocker
before it, clutching my mother's letter.
"Well, see you tomorrow," says Haymitch.
As the clinking of his bag of liquor bottles fades away, I
whisper, "I doubt it."
I am unable to move from the chair. The rest of the
house looms cold and empty and dark. I pull an old shawl
over my body and watch the flames. I guess I sleep,
because the next thing I know, it's morning and Greasy
Sae's banging around at the stove. She makes me eggs
and toast and sits there until I've eaten it all. We don't talk
much. Her little granddaughter, the one who lives in her own
world, takes a bright blue ball of yarn from my mother's
knitting basket. Greasy Sae tells her to put it back, but I say
she can have it. No one in this house can knit anymore.
After breakfast, Greasy Sae does the dishes and leaves,
but she comes back up at dinnertime to make me eat
again. I don't know if she's just being neighborly or if she's
on the government's payroll, but she shows up twice every
day. She cooks, I consume. I try to figure out my next move.
There's no obstacle now to taking my life. But I seem to be
waiting for something.
Sometimes the phone rings and rings and rings, but I
don't pick it up. Haymitch never visits. Maybe he changed
his mind and left, although I suspect he's just drunk. No one
comes but Greasy Sae and her granddaughter. After
months of solitary confinement, they seem like a crowd.
"Spring's in the air today. You ought to get out," she
says. "Go hunting."
I haven't left the house. I haven't even left the kitchen
except to go to the small bathroom a few steps off of it. I'm
in the same clothes I left the Capitol in. What I do is sit by
the fire. Stare at the unopened letters piling up on the
mantel. "I don't have a bow."
"Check down the hall," she says.
After she leaves, I consider a trip down the hall. Rule it
out. But after several hours, I go anyway, walking in silent
sock feet, so as not to awaken the ghosts. In the study,
where I had my tea with President Snow, I find a box with
my father's hunting jacket, our plant book, my parents'
wedding photo, the spile Haymitch sent in, and the locket
Peeta gave me in the clock arena. The two bows and a
sheath of arrows Gale rescued on the night of the
firebombing lie on the desk. I put on the hunting jacket and
leave the rest of the stuff untouched. I fall asleep on the sofa
in the formal living room. A terrible nightmare follows, where
I'm lying at the bottom of a deep grave, and every dead
person I know by name comes by and throws a shovel full of
ashes on me. It's quite a long dream, considering the list of
people, and the deeper I'm buried, the harder it is to
breathe. I try to call out, begging them to stop, but the ashes
fill my mouth and nose and I can't make any sound. Still the
shovel scrapes on and on and on....
I wake with a start. Pale morning light comes around
the edges of the shutters. The scraping of the shovel
continues. Still half in the nightmare, I run down the hall, out
the front door, and around the side of the house, because
now I'm pretty sure I can scream at the dead. When I see
him, I pull up short. His face is flushed from digging up the
ground under the windows. In a wheelbarrow are five
scraggly bushes.
"You're back," I say.
"Dr. Aurelius wouldn't let me leave the Capitol until
yesterday," Peeta says. "By the way, he said to tell you he
can't keep pretending he's treating you forever. You have to
pick up the phone."
He looks well. Thin and covered with burn scars like
me, but his eyes have lost that clouded, tortured look. He's
frowning slightly, though, as he takes me in. I make a
halfhearted effort to push my hair out of my eyes and realize
it's matted into clumps. I feel defensive. "What are you
doing?"
"I went to the woods this morning and dug these up.
For her," he says. "I thought we could plant them along the
side of the house."
I look at the bushes, the clods of dirt hanging from their
roots, and catch my breath as the word rose registers. I'm
about to yell vicious things at Peeta when the full name
comes to me. Not plain rose but evening primrose. The
flower my sister was named for. I give Peeta a nod of
assent and hurry back into the house, locking the door
behind me. But the evil thing is inside, not out. Trembling
with weakness and anxiety, I run up the stairs. My foot
catches on the last step and I crash onto the floor. I force
myself to rise and enter my room. The smell's very faint but
still laces the air. It's there. The white rose among the dried
flowers in the vase. Shriveled and fragile, but holding on to
that unnatural perfection cultivated in Snow's greenhouse. I
grab the vase, stumble down to the kitchen, and throw its
contents into the embers. As the flowers flare up, a burst of
blue flame envelops the rose and devours it. Fire beats
roses again. I smash the vase on the floor for good
measure.
Back upstairs, I throw open the bedroom windows to
clear out the rest of Snow's stench. But it still lingers, on my
clothes and in my pores. I strip, and flakes of skin the size
of playing cards cling to the garments. Avoiding the mirror, I
step into the shower and scrub the roses from my hair, my
body, my mouth. Bright pink and tingling, I find something
clean to wear. It takes half an hour to comb out my hair.
Greasy Sae unlocks the front door. While she makes
breakfast, I feed the clothes I had shed to the fire. At her
suggestion, I pare off my nails with a knife.
Over the eggs, I ask her, "Where did Gale go?"
"District Two. Got some fancy job there. I see him now
and again on the television," she says.
I dig around inside myself, trying to register anger,
hatred, longing. I find only relief.
"I'm going hunting today," I say.
"Well, I wouldn't mind some fresh game at that," she
answers.
I arm myself with a bow and arrows and head out,
intending to exit 12 through the Meadow. Near the square
are teams of masked and gloved people with horse-drawn
carts. Sifting through what lay under the snow this winter.
Gathering remains. A cart's parked in front of the mayor's
house. I recognize Thom, Gale's old crewmate, pausing a
moment to wipe the sweat from his face with a rag. I
remember seeing him in 13, but he must have come back.
His greeting gives me the courage to ask, "Did they find
anyone in there?"
"Whole family. And the two people who worked for
them," Thom tells me.
Madge. Quiet and kind and brave. The girl who gave
me the pin that gave me a name. I swallow hard. Wonder if
she'll be joining the cast of my nightmares tonight.
Shoveling the ashes into my mouth. "I thought maybe, since
he was the mayor..."
"I don't think being the mayor of Twelve put the odds in
his favor," says Thom.
I nod and keep moving, careful not to look in the back
of the cart. All through the town and the Seam, it's the
same. The reaping of the dead. As I near the ruins of my
old house, the road becomes thick with carts. The
Meadow's gone, or at least dramatically altered. A deep pit
has been dug, and they're lining it with bones, a mass
grave for my people. I skirt around the hole and enter the
woods at my usual place. It doesn't matter, though. The
fence isn't charged anymore and has been propped up with
long branches to keep out the predators. But old habits die
hard. I think about going to the lake, but I'm so weak that I
barely make it to my meeting place with Gale. I sit on the
rock where Cressida filmed us, but it's too wide without his
body beside me. Several times I close my eyes and count
to ten, thinking that when I open them, he will have
materialized without a sound as he so often did. I have to
remind myself that Gale's in 2 with a fancy job, probably
kissing another pair of lips.
It is the old Katniss's favorite kind of day. Early spring.
The woods awakening after the long winter. But the spurt of
energy that began with the primroses fades away. By the
time I make it back to the fence, I'm so sick and dizzy,
Thom has to give me a ride home in the dead people's
cart. Help me to the sofa in the living room, where I watch
the dust motes spin in the thin shafts of afternoon light.
My head snaps around at the hiss, but it takes awhile
to believe he's real. How could he have gotten here? I take
in the claw marks from some wild animal, the back paw he
holds slightly above the ground, the prominent bones in his
face. He's come on foot, then, all the way from 13. Maybe
they kicked him out or maybe he just couldn't stand it there
without her, so he came looking.
"It was the waste of a trip. She's not here," I tell him.
Buttercup hisses again. "She's not here. You can hiss all
you like. You won't find Prim." At her name, he perks up.
Raises his flattened ears. Begins to meow hopefully. "Get
out!" He dodges the pillow I throw at him. "Go away!
There's nothing left for you here!" I start to shake, furious
with him. "She's not coming back! She's never ever coming
back here again!" I grab another pillow and get to my feet
to improve my aim. Out of nowhere, the tears begin to pour
down my cheeks. "She's dead." I clutch my middle to dull
the pain. Sink down on my heels, rocking the pillow, crying.
"She's dead, you stupid cat. She's dead." A new sound,
part crying, part singing, comes out of my body, giving
voice to my despair. Buttercup begins to wail as well. No
matter what I do, he won't go. He circles me, just out of
reach, as wave after wave of sobs racks my body, until
eventually I fall unconscious. But he must understand. He
must know that the unthinkable has happened and to
survive will require previously unthinkable acts. Because
hours later, when I come to in my bed, he's there in the
moonlight. Crouched beside me, yellow eyes alert,
guarding me from the night.
In the morning, he sits stoically as I clean the cuts, but
digging the thorn from his paw brings on a round of those
kitten mews. We both end up crying again, only this time we
comfort each other. On the strength of this, I open the letter
Haymitch gave me from my mother, dial the phone number,
and weep with her as well. Peeta, bearing a warm loaf of
bread, shows up with Greasy Sae. She makes us breakfast
and I feed all my bacon to Buttercup.
Slowly, with many lost days, I come back to life. I try to
follow Dr. Aurelius's advice, just going through the motions,
amazed when one finally has meaning again. I tell him my
idea about the book, and a large box of parchment sheets
arrives on the next train from the Capitol.
I got the idea from our family's plant book. The place
where we recorded those things you cannot trust to
memory. The page begins with the person's picture. A
photo if we can find it. If not, a sketch or painting by Peeta.
Then, in my most careful handwriting, come all the details it
would be a crime to forget. Lady licking Prim's cheek. My
father's laugh. Peeta's father with the cookies. The color of
Finnick's eyes. What Cinna could do with a length of silk.
Boggs reprogramming the Holo. Rue poised on her toes,
arms slightly extended, like a bird about to take flight. On
and on. We seal the pages with salt water and promises to
live well to make their deaths count. Haymitch finally joins
us, contributing twenty-three years of tributes he was forced
to mentor. Additions become smaller. An old memory that
surfaces. A late primrose preserved between the pages.
Strange bits of happiness, like the photo of Finnick and
Annie's newborn son.
We learn to keep busy again. Peeta bakes. I hunt.
Haymitch drinks until the liquor runs out, and then raises
geese until the next train arrives. Fortunately, the geese can
take pretty good care of themselves. We're not alone. A
few hundred others return because, whatever has
happened, this is our home. With the mines closed, they
plow the ashes into the earth and plant food. Machines from
the Capitol break ground for a new factory where we will
make medicines. Although no one seeds it, the Meadow
turns green again.
Peeta and I grow back together. There are still
moments when he clutches the back of a chair and hangs
on until the flashbacks are over. I wake screaming from
nightmares of mutts and lost children. But his arms are
there to comfort me. And eventually his lips. On the night I
feel that thing again, the hunger that overtook me on the
beach, I know this would have happened anyway. That what
I need to survive is not Gale's fire, kindled with rage and
hatred. I have plenty of fire myself. What I need is the
dandelion in the spring. The bright yellow that means rebirth
instead of destruction. The promise that life can go on, no
matter how bad our losses. That it can be good again. And
only Peeta can give me that.
So after, when he whispers, "You love me. Real or not
real?"
I tell him, "Real."
EPILOGUE
They play in the Meadow. The dancing girl with the
dark hair and blue eyes. The boy with blond curls and gray
eyes, struggling to keep up with her on his chubby toddler
legs. It took five, ten, fifteen years for me to agree. But
Peeta wanted them so badly. When I first felt her stirring
inside of me, I was consumed with a terror that felt as old
as life itself. Only the joy of holding her in my arms could
tame it. Carrying him was a little easier, but not much.
The questions are just beginning. The arenas have
been completely destroyed, the memorials built, there are
no more Hunger Games. But they teach about them at
school, and the girl knows we played a role in them. The
boy will know in a few years. How can I tell them about that
world without frightening them to death? My children, who
take the words of the song for granted:
Deep in the meadow, under the willow
A bed of grass, a soft green pillow
Lay down your head, and close your sleepy
eyes
And when again they open, the sun will rise.
Here it's safe, here it's warm
Here the daisies guard you from every harm
Here your dreams are sweet and tomorrow
brings them true
Here is the place where I love you.
My children, who don't know they play on a graveyard.
Peeta says it will be okay. We have each other. And
the book. We can make them understand in a way that will
make them braver. But one day I'll have to explain about my
nightmares. Why they came. Why they won't ever really go
away.
I'll tell them how I survive it. I'll tell them that on bad
mornings, it feels impossible to take pleasure in anything
because I'm afraid it could be taken away. That's when I
make a list in my head of every act of goodness I've seen
someone do. It's like a game. Repetitive. Even a little
tedious after more than twenty years.
But there are much worse games to play.
